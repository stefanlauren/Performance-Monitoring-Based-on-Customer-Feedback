      "INCORRECT COURSE MATERIAL - The course would often provide guidelines that were needed to complete assignments for the course then assessors would fail the assignment for using their guidelines.5. The course highlights once you get a free nail kit with the course after paying at least 50% for the course which is fine by me. Daughter found course information on this company's website to be in-correct and misleading; customer service advisor also gave in-correct course information. This is the first time I have studied through a distant learning course and the materials you receive are enough to get you through the course. It was a really good course and the instructor was flexible with being able to complete the required course work on time. Biggest mistake I made was going with this course provider , I had to pay about £600 for my course plus pay for exam fees every time . Material, course content, late exam I liked the training delivery and also the set up however the course did feel a little rushed.\n"

Years ago, I thought LinkedIn was quite good.Two months ago, I would have said it was Facebook with a business bias - i.e. If LinkedIn wants me to pay for it, provide 99.9% decent content, with some relevant ads, and I might want to pay a small sum to remove the ads.

Can you imagine paying 1500 dollars for a course while the author behind it is using \"unlisted youtube videos\" to teach students? \n",

FutureLearn offer many free online courses. I have found all courses professional, well presented and allow for discussion amongst fellow students about the topic presented.

They are refusing to refund this amount because I continued a free course which I had started prior to subscribing. Paid for a course did it and passed test.

We need the student or child to understand why and what he is doing ... it’s not class to class teaching which is important... I enrolled my daughter for the trial class and at the end of the class she said she doesn't like coding. The overall experience of WhiteHat Jr coding program is rated as average as the entire experience is dependent on the kind of teacher gets allocated to the student. In the time since, I have received four emails, five text messages, and three phone calls reminding me of the upcoming class. Are you still want to \"suggest\" how my feedback should look?It's very annoying that a company like WhiteHat Jr pretends to control the way customer leave feedback.Wake up guys!

Firebrand do offer good courses and accelerated training, I have had 3 courses with Firebrand over the course of my apprenticeship. I felt the course was more geared to passing the exam instead of learning the content.My recommendation if you are attending a Firebrand course. Other training providers offer anything between 3 to 5 days for such a course, whereas Firebrand only trained us for 1.5 days (the afternoon is for the exam). I asked Firebrand to send me the books for the course 6 months before my course date so I could study them.

Here is a copy of the email:I can confirm that we have received your request to cancel your course, and thus your course cancellation has been approved. The course included written theory only, with poor diagrams and nothing in the way of videos or examples (essential I would say on a massage course)!

I took one course 3 years ago and didn't like it, I took another course recently but they are just getting worse. Firebrand do offer good courses and accelerated training, I have had 3 courses with Firebrand over the course of my apprenticeship. This is the first time I have studied through a distant learning course and the materials you receive are enough to get you through the course.\n"

The courses I've attended at Firebrand occupy 10+ hrs of your time each day; this time is essential to cover the course material. I've done a few training courses with Firebrand now and Alex has always tried to steer me onto the courses that would be right for me.

It seems like course quality drops steadily, and search gets progressively because it gets swamped by IBM and Microsoft garbage courses.Disabling access to courses after some deadlines is ridiculous. I even tested other courses (work fine) and I even created a test-account, enrolled to this course and could successfully click \"Upgrade to Verified\". The courses are great, however courses ended before posted end time on every occasion. Good courses generally, but I noticed that some courses are not clear sufficiently, lots of informations in a very short time. \n",

Udacity offer to us a great practice and amazing experience, thank you Udacity a wonderful experience with my first project at udacity! This course would be a great starting point for someone with some ML experience but would like to learn more about Deep Learning. Awesome program, short and effective, and oriented towards helping you get a job!When I completed the program, the platform hadn't perfected their professional help program. This Nanodegree went beyond my initial expectations.The course materials have a good quality, and also I learned many useful things regarding PostgreSQL, the database used throughout the course. It was so good..knowledgeable With my experience of learning from different sources, Udacity is really top with clear explanation and real time project work.

      "I took one course 3 years ago and didn't like it, I took another course recently but they are just getting worse. Course: DevOps I have recently completed two Udacity \"nanodegree\" courses: UX Design and Product Management. A fraud, the free courses are taught well but the main (PAID) courses are taught badly and don't make sense. Each course gave me a better understanding of what the jobs are about (something I couldn't find in short courses from coursera or udemy). I have done a previous IT degree  -  the course is FAR TOO EXPENSIVE and the quality of teaching for the paid courses are terrible. The refund policy: You have only two days to decide if you want to continue doing the course or not.

They tried to trick us into signing up for more classes and when we politely declined and gave written feedback, they’ve called multiple times per day since. These guys have not stopped calling me after my child took a class and I immediately informed that this stuff does not interest my kid. Their marketing team and counsellors suck big time no sense on when to call and keep calling and messaging at all odd times to sell, sell and sell. In the time since, I have received four emails, five text messages, and three phone calls reminding me of the upcoming class. We need the student or child to understand why and what he is doing ... it’s not class to class teaching which is important... After that they asked me to take 3 demo classes, in those classes one of the employee will act like a student. \n",

Material, course content, late exam I liked the training delivery and also the set up however the course did feel a little rushed. Other training providers offer anything between 3 to 5 days for such a course, whereas Firebrand only trained us for 1.5 days (the afternoon is for the exam). I felt the course was more geared to passing the exam instead of learning the content.My recommendation if you are attending a Firebrand course. Hello I did a SCCM course with Firebrand which is normally a 9 day course if you want to learn it properly. The Hotel was ok. Level of training was ok The courses are well organised and structured but the quality of the course really depends on who the tutor is. I asked Firebrand to send me the books for the course 6 months before my course date so I could study them. \n",

The tutors and the course content was excellent, but the customer service was poor and has put me off doing future online courses.

I have spent an hour out of my valuable time trying to find an email address or way of contacting customer support with no success. And also, had you had customer service via email, you wouldn't have had this review at this point. You're supposed to email a generic address and wait for however long it takes for someone to come back to you (on email only, they won't call you).

Biggest mistake I made was going with this course provider , I had to pay about £600 for my course plus pay for exam fees every time . Now ready to resume studies, ICS Learn has told him he’s only got 5 weeks to complete the course, despite having 14/15 weeks left when he suspended the studies. I have paid tuition fees to ICS therefore ICS must take responsibility to ensure that students get their certificate upon completion of the course. I have been studying with ICS Learn for two months now and I must say the amount of errors in the course material is really poor. All was explained correctly about paying the course but was left not knowing how to go forward after paying my money as in starting the course.

The idea is that you have feedback from Step 4 before you do Step 6, but I have even waited until after the Step 6 deadline and my Step 4 still hadn't been marked.Overall, I wish it would be simple enough to change apprenticeship providers because trying to deal with customer service at BPP is extremely stressful and makes my whole experience completely unenjoyable. I had emailed in to book to the correct email address, where they informed me that I should email a different address. Avoid, avoid, avoid!They are grossly incompetent and their Customer Service is something I have not come across before. Good for masochists who like to be belittled and treated like scum by peopole who think they are special, but not so good for people wanting a professional qualification delivered by professionals. Happy to take your money but not happy to fulfill their end of the bargain I thankfully only bought a book not an exam or an apprenticeship, however I advice you to avoid avoid!I ONLY bought it because they said they had an app which hasn’t been updated for the past 8 MONTHS!However it doesn’t open, you can hardly download it.Not to mention you can’t even do exams in it!And to top it off you can’t even use it on different devices at the same time!If i knew this before I would not have spent my money on them.If you can avoid them by all means.😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡 Having decided to pursue ACCA after years out of education, I decided to book my CBAs at BPP Liverpool Street.

That being said my only concerns would be the incorrect spelling of terms in a few places(minor), my only major concern was in GTx - CS1301xII or GTx - CS1301xIII where i found the code written for a problem was incorrect and had to factor that in my solution to attain the correct answer.

What a crap company...tutors are crap and their managers are worse. 6 months in no assessor for first 2 months then when we did get an assessor she was a new employee so didn't have a clue what she was doing and quit after a month another month before we got a new assessor who threw loads of course work at us to be completed in unrealistic time frame as well as doing a very hard job full time this was impossible.she lasted 2 months and quit no assessor at the moment.

      "In my experience the revenue-model of Linkedin has changed into a no “matter what” revenue-model. Focus on skills, request skills endorsements and recommendations. Disable their app but it's re-enabled every time motorola send a \"security update\" - or rather an insecurity update. Also connect with many colleges with similar roles and exchange in intelligent STORIES that can a) attract comments of experts with similar roles b) most importantly when recruiters see your cv they will realise you CAN EN-LIGHT THE EXPERTS!! At the time I accepted this, the text on the website assured me that I would be contacted before any payment for this subscription was taken, after the free trial period ended.Of course I never received any notification, and they just took the money, via PayPal.LinkedIn's customer support email address, as supplied to PayPal, is unmonitored, which rang alarm bells.PayPal, unsurprisingly, found in LinkedIn's favour and would not refund the payment.LinkedIn's 'policy' is that any payments are 'non-refundable' - this is both unreasonable business practice, and effectively unlawful.As their 'customer service' is virtually non-contactable, by any method, the only recourse remaining is a legal one. Extremely Poor Customer Service At LinkedIn:You literally cannot get hold of a human being - either by email, feedback forms or phone.As far as I am concerned LinkedIn is housed by a set of useless, faceless bureaucrats supposedly supporting the business community.Since you can get nowhere with the faceless idiots at LinkedIn I have today written a formal letter of complaint to LinkedIn’s ultimate boss - Mr Bill Gates, Founder of Microsoft.I now expect management heads at LinkedIn to roll - because their customer service is quite simply useless.What the hell do LinkedIn think they are playing at?1 star only our of 5. Very unusual way to treat paying customers.Sure, why not get money from the people who aren't using the premium account but already have one.If you want to cancel the already paid premium service - you lose all paid features and recover nothing.To be honest - the worst paid subscription model I have ever meet. \n",

You can improve yourself step by step. The only criticism I have is that on the Dashboard, when you click on a particular Playlist, instead of taking you to that particular Playlist, it takes you to a list of all your Playlists and you have to find the one you are looking for from that list. 2) On the website: when you actually load up the course details and see the course overview with the chapters and episodes, it would be very nice if, when you have already watched some episodes of a chapter, to have the most recently watched chapter episode list automatically open out and the browser scroll down to the next unwatched episode - sounds kind of minor but it's actually pretty annoying after a while.

The idea is that you have feedback from Step 4 before you do Step 6, but I have even waited until after the Step 6 deadline and my Step 4 still hadn't been marked.Overall, I wish it would be simple enough to change apprenticeship providers because trying to deal with customer service at BPP is extremely stressful and makes my whole experience completely unenjoyable. I had emailed in to book to the correct email address, where they informed me that I should email a different address. Avoid, avoid, avoid!They are grossly incompetent and their Customer Service is something I have not come across before. Good for masochists who like to be belittled and treated like scum by peopole who think they are special, but not so good for people wanting a professional qualification delivered by professionals. Happy to take your money but not happy to fulfill their end of the bargain I thankfully only bought a book not an exam or an apprenticeship, however I advice you to avoid avoid!I ONLY bought it because they said they had an app which hasn’t been updated for the past 8 MONTHS!However it doesn’t open, you can hardly download it.Not to mention you can’t even do exams in it!And to top it off you can’t even use it on different devices at the same time!If i knew this before I would not have spent my money on them.If you can avoid them by all means.😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡 Having decided to pursue ACCA after years out of education, I decided to book my CBAs at BPP Liverpool Street.

PRICING METHODS- The first negative aspect of Udemy is the pricing methods. My laptop tells me the course costs 37$, my desktop tells me it costs 15$ and my phone tells me the price is 10$....I tried buying the course from all devices both with Paypal and 2 different cards, was not allowed to buy it with any of them. I think the platform needs to ask: is it a platform largely targeted at the Get-rich-quick and affiliate markets or will they shift to being a platform that markets high quality learning. I bought a course for 129 British pound and then the next day my friend bought it for 12 British pound that is like 90% cheaper. \n",

      "The course materials are better structured, more comprehensive in covering the syllabus and better quality in this presentation.The structure of the day and the week is well organised and admin around organising the actual exams is made as easy as possible with the exams being booked in advance to take place within the week of the course (unlike competitors who have moved away from this to drive down their own costs! The trainers are both well experienced in the relevant field but also talented trainers who understand how to train a room full of individuals with differing experiences themselves and ways of Learning. Overall my experience of their courses has been far superior to cheaper alternative companies offering the same courses. Good quality training - good trainers and well designed course materials. Any questions that candidates had were addressed immediately and when further explanation was requested it was covered without fuss.Managing a group of 20+ candidates remotely would be a challenge to most but our trainer was professional and controlled this with ease.The booking process, pre-course material, delivery of text books and access to session was excellent. Very quick turnaround with punctual replies to emails and explaining every step of the process with helpful tips for interviewing. Thank you Had a fantastic one day course led by Dragoslav, there's only so much you can learn in one day but this introduction from QA gave me a great start has inspired me to continue my web development journey. \n",

      "Went through the full process with them, applied for a role, did multiple interviews and was told that I had the role.Then weeks went by with no contact, I tried to contact both of the staff at QA dealing with the role no response via email and won't pick up the phone.Contacted head office and they can't get me through to them either or talk about the position.So I resorted to contacting the business who would have been taking me on as an apprentice who have also told me they had been cut off by QA.This isn't just days or weeks of being cut off now it's been months. I recently attended a 3 day BCS Foundation Certificate in Business Analyst provided by this company recently. I am not someone who typical writes reviews, however I do feel let down by this organisation and can really relate to the numerous poor reviews attributed to this company. Was appalled by anti Irish racist commentary and aggressive teaching style. The customer service is disappointing. From experience thats not true. Then a recommendation to call them which just leads to going straight to voicemail. \n",

      "No pressure, it went smooth, regular coffee breaks, 24/7 lab availability, WiFi availability and unlimited snack availability makes it a homely experience. Did what it said 🤓 It's a very good course, however I would of given 5* if we had received the 400 page data science book with more than a few weeks till the course at Firebrand (As nice as the book is).Appreciate it's a reference tool, but would of been good to be able to read it in advance.Also there seems to be an endless array of url's to go to that,  whilst appreciated, would potentially be better if stored in a single repository of go-to links for the course in Onefile.That aside, everyone is friendly, helpful and the course itself whilst being a little woolly at times (seems to cover anything and everything to do with computers and data at times from SQL, R, Analysis, data science, big data, databases, architecture etc) is running at a not impossible pace and is already yielding benefits.Hope this helps and doesn't sound like a dig, the course is very good and I appreciate the work that had gone into making it as good as it is.Than youWayne I would definitely recommend Firebrand to someone looking to do an apprenticeship or just to complete a course and gain a qualification. I took five courses with Firebrand, three in the UK and two in The Netherlands (LEAN Green+Black Belt UK, TOGAF Practicioner UK, SCRUM Master NL, Prince2 Practicioner NL). But also the MD-100 and MD-101 exams.Thank you! It's as advertised. Gary is a credit to Firebrand, thank-you Gary!! My motivation deteriorates. \n",

      "I believe sample questions provided by was wastage of time as exam question was no where related to those.If instructor advised to buy the sample questions book from ISC2 website then that should have been advised well before so people can buy in advance.i believe sample questions provided should be replaced witht he sample questions book from ISC as only around 35-40 candidates passed which was well below the % claimed. There is 1 dish choice for lunch and 1 dish choice for dinner. Take note: Firebrand has some good trainers and materials, however with the PMI-ACP materials and trainers (2) the materials did not change either time except for the quizzes at the end of each and the trainers, while both very knowledgable were not trainers. Never again, never ever. Firebrand believe that there so called accelerated learning is beneficial and is a good method of learning.what they fail to tell you is that you will be expected to sit in a classroom all day from 8:30 am until 7 -8 pm listening to a lecturer rambling on whilst going through presentations NO PRACTICAL LEARNING, which is not beneficial.being expected to sit in a classroom for these periods of time has a very negative impact on a persons mental; health trying to cram in so much material along with the long days made me incredibly stressed, I have a good knowledge of mental health problems from working for an NHS Mental health trust and deeply appalled by the style of learning that Firebrand offer as it can have a very negative affect on a persons mental well being. Rooms are standard and clean and bathroom is like hospital bathrooms in your room. So basically it was just a rush to get it done, using click click click mouse, not really having enough time to understand what you were doing, so not as much learned as possible. \n",

      "Horrible Horrible horrible company. Excuse after excuse! 6 months in no assessor for first 2 months then when we did get an assessor she was a new employee so didn't have a clue what she was doing and quit after a month another month before we got a new assessor who threw loads of course work at us to be completed in unrealistic time frame as well as doing a very hard job full time this was impossible.she lasted 2 months and quit no assessor at the moment. What a crap company...tutors are crap and their managers are worse. So I enrolled and 15 days later call to explain that I have come across some financial emergencies and won’t be able to make payments, I was told you cannot cancel the course after 14 days, so I even agreed to pay for the first month even though I didn’t do anything at all, haven’t started but now I’m told whether I continue with the course or not I am still required to pay the whole £1600 for the entire course, the first time I see a no cancellation place.My advice get your finances in place before enrolling and even though they say enroll now pay later if you enroll mid month at the end of that month the payment is required, that’s something no one explains when you enroll, I had in mind that the first payment will be required 4 weeks later which is a month but just 2 weeks!!! Lastly, the peer support is almost entirely composed of people asking to join external whatsapp groups, there is almost no peer support within the course. So who’s lying????? \n",

      "In my experience the revenue-model of Linkedin has changed into a no “matter what” revenue-model. Disable their app but it's re-enabled every time motorola send a \"security update\" - or rather an insecurity update. At the time I accepted this, the text on the website assured me that I would be contacted before any payment for this subscription was taken, after the free trial period ended.Of course I never received any notification, and they just took the money, via PayPal.LinkedIn's customer support email address, as supplied to PayPal, is unmonitored, which rang alarm bells.PayPal, unsurprisingly, found in LinkedIn's favour and would not refund the payment.LinkedIn's 'policy' is that any payments are 'non-refundable' - this is both unreasonable business practice, and effectively unlawful.As their 'customer service' is virtually non-contactable, by any method, the only recourse remaining is a legal one. I have been a paid member for many years and although I haven't put a job on the site I am receiving responses to my jobs and I can't find the applicants on the site. Very unusual way to treat paying customers.Sure, why not get money from the people who aren't using the premium account but already have one.If you want to cancel the already paid premium service - you lose all paid features and recover nothing.To be honest - the worst paid subscription model I have ever meet. At the moment they are also violating the OPT-IN rules by sending newsletters which I did not ask for and they did not ask for permission. Not anymore so. \n",

However, it has turned out to be the biggest mistake I ever made...I was told I could pay the minimum deposit amount upfront (this minimum deposit amount was never confirmed in any email correspondence, only the figure £100 was used in a hypothetical repayment example) or I was told I could choose to pay any amount I wanted so I chose to pay £1000 upfront to take a chunk off of the monthly payments.

The rewind and fast-forward features need to become more prominent in the interface and allow granular control so that I can move back three seconds exactly, instead of moving the control backward and randomly being stuck having to view the last twenty seconds all over again because the control does not provide granular manipulation.

I find this behavior inappropriate. Unfortunately, their 3 weeks period of waiting to receive assessment results is really frustrating especially as other providers are able to mark assessment within just a few hours! My experience with DPG wasn't bad, my only worry was that I had to follow up on a couple of things etc, scheduled calls, invoice, contract etc The most shocking treatment I have ever received from any company. Online facilitators get back to you really quickly but it is a shame you don't get one tutor that you can build a rapport with, it's pot luck who gets back to you, would have liked a bit of continuity - all have been helpful though. Lastly on a personal note, I know have to wait until July to attend the programme which is four months away and now means I only get to qualify at the end of January next year as apposed to October this year.

The idea is that you have feedback from Step 4 before you do Step 6, but I have even waited until after the Step 6 deadline and my Step 4 still hadn't been marked.Overall, I wish it would be simple enough to change apprenticeship providers because trying to deal with customer service at BPP is extremely stressful and makes my whole experience completely unenjoyable. Avoid, avoid, avoid!They are grossly incompetent and their Customer Service is something I have not come across before. I had emailed in to book to the correct email address, where they informed me that I should email a different address. Good for masochists who like to be belittled and treated like scum by peopole who think they are special, but not so good for people wanting a professional qualification delivered by professionals. Happy to take your money but not happy to fulfill their end of the bargain I thankfully only bought a book not an exam or an apprenticeship, however I advice you to avoid avoid!I ONLY bought it because they said they had an app which hasn’t been updated for the past 8 MONTHS!However it doesn’t open, you can hardly download it.Not to mention you can’t even do exams in it!And to top it off you can’t even use it on different devices at the same time!If i knew this before I would not have spent my money on them.If you can avoid them by all means.😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡 Having decided to pursue ACCA after years out of education, I decided to book my CBAs at BPP Liverpool Street.

      "I then rang customer service who said that I had emailed the wrong email address and should have emailed the first address which is why it never got booked, even though I had emailed that address in the first place.There has been another occasion where i emailed in and didn't get a response after 2 weeks.I have had a number of calls to customer service where they have been rude and unhelpful, and in one case I was told an issue would be rectified, I rang again a few days later (a lovely lady answered) and she informed me that the previous call handler didn't even log an issue in the first place.I have had issues with access to my hub account, which have taken 2 weeks to sort, which meant i was 2 weeks behind on my course as i had no access to learning materials; however they refused to move me to a course which had a later start date, so I have been unable to qualify for pass assurance.On a number of times I have telephoned due to an urgent matter i have been told to 'email in with urgent as the reference and it will get sorted today' and then when I finally have a response two days later, I am told I should have rang in instead of emailed because they cannot respond to urgent emails quick enough.I have been emailed the incorrect dates for my current revision course, which I am now unable to attend one of the days because of this.They are extremely slow in marking the 'Step 4 and 6' which are meant to aid your learning and give feedback to help you improve your written answers. The idea is that you have feedback from Step 4 before you do Step 6, but I have even waited until after the Step 6 deadline and my Step 4 still hadn't been marked.Overall, I wish it would be simple enough to change apprenticeship providers because trying to deal with customer service at BPP is extremely stressful and makes my whole experience completely unenjoyable. Avoid, avoid, avoid!They are grossly incompetent and their Customer Service is something I have not come across before. I had emailed in to book to the correct email address, where they informed me that I should email a different address. Good for masochists who like to be belittled and treated like scum by peopole who think they are special, but not so good for people wanting a professional qualification delivered by professionals. Happy to take your money but not happy to fulfill their end of the bargain I thankfully only bought a book not an exam or an apprenticeship, however I advice you to avoid avoid!I ONLY bought it because they said they had an app which hasn’t been updated for the past 8 MONTHS!However it doesn’t open, you can hardly download it.Not to mention you can’t even do exams in it!And to top it off you can’t even use it on different devices at the same time!If i knew this before I would not have spent my money on them.If you can avoid them by all means.😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡 Having decided to pursue ACCA after years out of education, I decided to book my CBAs at BPP Liverpool Street. Their marketing is just fluff. \n",

I did two different videogames courses on it - the teaching material was very good, and so was the speaker.I liked the fact that I had to do some homework each week, and that it was graded by peers, even though that system isn't perfect - some peers gave some insightful, constructive feedback on my work, others clearly just didn't put much time or energy into it and gave some generic feedback that wasn't especially helpful. \n",

Some TAs have gone as far as to apologize on the message board to those who mentioned the issue, then say they will specifically review that person's answer and adjust the grade, but that person may be one of hundreds with the same issue and it is not fair to change one person's grade while not touching the faulty grader code and not revisiting every single person's answer that was correct but falsely rejected (obviously not feasible and thus extra unfair to fix one person only).There is also very, very little staff/community TA support on message boards for most courses I have taken.

Udacity though expects everyone to be very good in data structures and algorithms are not beginner-friendly courses for most of the courses they offer.You need at least a very strong understanding of data structures and algorithms if you want to ace intermediate and advanced courses.The beginner paid courses offered by Udacity is the best I have ever experienced from learning and satisfaction point of view.Though Udacity fails to guide you through the data structures and algorithms understanding of intermediate and advanced courses and though it presumes you already have at least a very professional background on these courses, it is a very good course which simulates like a real job environment situation.

I've just completed the first week and have really enjoyed the mix of spoken script, video and real life scenario to introduce the subject.

Is there any value in this certificate?Look at this from Futurelearn;  Is FutureLearn accredited?All certificates state the minimum number of hours required per week and the length of the course, so you can claim that many hours of CPD (Continuing Professional Development) by showing your employer or organisation the certificate.The majority of learners who purchase them add them to their CV, but it's important to note that certificates do not imply the award of credit points or the conferment of a university qualification.Where a course or program is accredited this information will be included on the course  .... this is from futurelearn website.I paid 62 pounds for a non accredited course!!! i was considering doing a course and even paying for one but i think i got a really lucky escape future learn is a sham for reals it would hack into my connection over flow it and then when i came back to log in it said invalid email or password this isnt the first time it did this it does this on a constant basis not once it will do this once every time i even get into it and i have had enough deleted my account i was considering paying for the free course i was viewing but if i left a comment they didnt like and cos i was a free learner they would fk everything up even my connection then block me from my account oh no ya dont deleted really the worst free piece of sh!t i have ever encountered !!!

I did an online book keeping course and upgraded so I could take the test.The test questions was not explained properly and I got 6 out of the 9 questions right, They deemed this as an average of 48% which is not correct and didn't receive a certificate. I joined their ‘unlimited’ subscription last week subject to their 14 day cooling off period and due to a change of personal circumstances, I no longer want this. There are two parts: Co-ordinator outside of the course, educators or facilitators in the course.Co-ordinator- Never response back (if they respond, you might have followed up a minimum 10 times)- lack of structural communication and accountability EducatorThis part is crucial.The way Futureture learn works; Course developed by somebody (University cannot confirm)And educators are just facilitators.I found that educators are- not prepare enough to understand where the course goes- hosting webinar only, no structure, no approach, and strategy on how to get the final output.- not involved in quality of output and contentThese are heads up for you. \n",

Thank you Had a fantastic one day course led by Dragoslav, there's only so much you can learn in one day but this introduction from QA gave me a great start has inspired me to continue my web development journey. Good quality training - good trainers and well designed course materials. The trainers are both well experienced in the relevant field but also talented trainers who understand how to train a room full of individuals with differing experiences themselves and ways of Learning. Any questions that candidates had were addressed immediately and when further explanation was requested it was covered without fuss.Managing a group of 20+ candidates remotely would be a challenge to most but our trainer was professional and controlled this with ease.The booking process, pre-course material, delivery of text books and access to session was excellent.

I took five courses with Firebrand, three in the UK and two in The Netherlands (LEAN Green+Black Belt UK, TOGAF Practicioner UK, SCRUM Master NL, Prince2 Practicioner NL). It's as advertised. Did what it said 🤓 It's a very good course, however I would of given 5* if we had received the 400 page data science book with more than a few weeks till the course at Firebrand (As nice as the book is).Appreciate it's a reference tool, but would of been good to be able to read it in advance.Also there seems to be an endless array of url's to go to that,  whilst appreciated, would potentially be better if stored in a single repository of go-to links for the course in Onefile.That aside, everyone is friendly, helpful and the course itself whilst being a little woolly at times (seems to cover anything and everything to do with computers and data at times from SQL, R, Analysis, data science, big data, databases, architecture etc) is running at a not impossible pace and is already yielding benefits.Hope this helps and doesn't sound like a dig, the course is very good and I appreciate the work that had gone into making it as good as it is.Than youWayne I would definitely recommend Firebrand to someone looking to do an apprenticeship or just to complete a course and gain a qualification.

The rewind and fast-forward features need to become more prominent in the interface and allow granular control so that I can move back three seconds exactly, instead of moving the control backward and randomly being stuck having to view the last twenty seconds all over again because the control does not provide granular manipulation.

My first module was referred as I hadn't added in references, so I had to wait 3 weeks for the referral mark, then another 3 weeks for the new feedback (which I passed) during which time I've submitted another 3 modules. Unfortunately, their 3 weeks period of waiting to receive assessment results is really frustrating especially as other providers are able to mark assessment within just a few hours! Lastly on a personal note, I know have to wait until July to attend the programme which is four months away and now means I only get to qualify at the end of January next year as apposed to October this year. I then had to go back and do the remaining modules that make up the diploma and they had agreed to Mark my work as a priority to make up for their administrative error. Online facilitators get back to you really quickly but it is a shame you don't get one tutor that you can build a rapport with, it's pot luck who gets back to you, would have liked a bit of continuity - all have been helpful though.

I liked the demo and course collateral but I found the advice given by the course advisors confusing and they didn’t really answer my questions Haven’t started the course yet but so far the enrolment process was quick, easy and efficient. Super quick and efficient enrolment A good booking experience. A good experience :) Fast and helpful reply with queries. Good service from start to finish, really helpful contact which made enrolling an easy decision I booked my course with DPG as I heard they were the best, although be careful when they say they are fully flexible....

Also, I enjoy reasonable high quality and that I can wait with the decision about whether or not I want to buy the course certificate - I enjoy that. However, if you're going to pursue a course's certification, then the cost is cheaper compared to other providers such as Udacity, edX, FutureLearn, etc. Pretty much all courses are made and run by recognized professors from well-known universities around the world.

      "I decide to cancel within the 14 day period. They do not mark assignments for weeks, the tutors don't respond it has truly caused me so much anxiety doing a course with these people. My opinion here is because so many people signed up recently, the tutors now look to have about 60 students each and they cannot cope with the volume of student queries so its taking 1 week+ to get any kind of reply, which dramatically slows down course progress.2) I've started to get threatening emails from ICS credit control as THEY have not set up my monthly direct debit correctly and my account is 25 days overdue. The majority of the good reviews come from customers leaving reviews after signing up with the super-smooth process or the in-house maths teacher asking you to rate her maths session, as you can see by my only other 2 reviews. Scrolling through the great many of the positive reviews relate to the on-boarding process for ICS, not the actual courses. I had a really bad experience with one tutor who I found rude and condescending and was asking for conflicting information to what was required by CIPD resulting in me receiving 2 X NYP for a piece of work in which I had correctly answered the question the first time around. I got no information about who my \"tutor\" was etc so i'm not entirely sure what my £800+ fee paid for since I had to purchase most of the guide books myself, most of the \"learning\" sections on the ICS website simply referred to the book and the most helpful content and mock tests were on the AAT website anyway.

Unfortunately with edX working with Microsoft, neither party wants to help out when there is an issue as both blame each other It wasn't clear what graded aspects of the course were available before purchasing and what deadlines were The good: I did an excellent course on Python programming in which I really learned a lot.

It can be a little frustrating when you're interrupted and have to go back and find where you left off (this doesn't apply to every single individual \"lesson\").Assessments - you are required to use Harvard Referencing which is fair enough. Average amount of support, I expected more due to the ratings and reviews. The turn over of staff at Avado meant that I didn't speak to the same tutor very often and in the end, the customer service manager did not even respond to my emails. Assignment 3, and the questions (\"assessment criteria\") aren't in the same sequence as the course weeks... the theory being that you can start your assignment as you study through the weeks...  but part of the second question I've JUST discovered in week 5.

Extremely Poor Customer Service At LinkedIn:You literally cannot get hold of a human being - either by email, feedback forms or phone. As far as I am concerned LinkedIn is housed by a set of useless, faceless bureaucrats supposedly supporting the business community. What the hell do LinkedIn think they are playing at?1 star only our of 5. Great for networking and reaching out to old work mates \n",

      "When a paid service gets renewed you have to send a reminder message!Feels like a scam: not even a thank you email after getting a new payment from you. Very unusual way to treat paying customers. To be honest - the worst paid subscription model I have ever meet. Two months ago, I would have said it was Facebook with a business bias - i.e. not at all good. Please improve the service before I leave for good. LinkedIn tricked me into signing up for a free trial of one of their services. i signed up for a 14 day trial. he steal your personal data and wasting your time.almost took 2 months to gather all my personal documents to see  whether im entitled to get legal aid or not, at the end, because of silly reason he said unfortunately you're not entitled.he included my income without taking out my expenditure from my business ( as im self employed). \n",

      "Summary for Firebrand Training - good feedback:\n",
      "It is essential that the instructor has real world experience of the topics they are reviewing, and this certainly is the case with Firebrand instructors, our instructor was flown over from New York and was extremely knowledgeable. but when it comes the CISSP trainer, Gwen Bettwy, there was nothing that would stop her in delviering a great training session, despite living in the US and delivering the training course at 2am US time for 8am UK time...Thanks Gwen, Firebrand training allowed me to fill the gaps i needed to succed on my CISSP certification. Stas the trainer was excellent and gave us everything both for passing the exam and working with AWS in the day job. Facilities, refreshments, and snacks were good. First class training experience. Thank you Steve - and Firebrand Firebrand is definitely very well suited to teaching apprenticeships and the instructor understood how to teach in many different styles which would suit anyone. I passed :-)\n",

      "Summary for Firebrand Training - bad feedback:\n",
      "De training is quite good but not sufficient to pass directly the test, it needs really some weeks of additional training or to have deeply study in advance. I would not recommend firebrand to anyone in my organisation, i have had virtually no support with the work i have done and each course is way too long to digest the information. If instructor advised to buy the sample questions book from ISC2 website then that should have been advised well before so people can buy in advance.i believe sample questions provided should be replaced witht he sample questions book from ISC as only around 35-40 candidates passed which was well below the % claimed. Its akin to the Double glazing salesmen of old trying to get you to sign up to things you don't want and then bombard you with marketing.***In Response to the reply, The \"See Prices Tab\" still asks for name, email and phone before it gives you prices. Good facilities, the trainers are fairly average. I can honestly say that very little of the content of his training actually appeared in the exam. I found a new employer who I am still working for after more than 12 months. First when not having English as native U could apply for 25% extra exam time. \n",

      "Summary for QA Ltd - good feedback:\n",
      "Was applying for jobs and found job through QA. Very quick turnaround with punctual replies to emails and explaining every step of the process with helpful tips for interviewing. Answered every question I had and made job hunting an enjoyable experience. The instructor was really helpful and patient. QA kept me informed and answered any queries that I raised promptly. I have taken 2 courses with QA (P3O and PRINCE2) both really enjoyable 1 week intense course (each). Not a fan of their online test papers (which they are moving to permanently) as I had an instance where when I was taking my exam for P3O the page kept hanging on the server for a total of 20 mins!! Value for Money!I have completed multiple AXELOS Foundation & Practitioner courses with both QA and also alternative training providers and would highly recommend QA for choice. \n",

      "Summary for QA Ltd - bad feedback:\n",
      "No answer from admin BCS Business Analysis Practitioner Certificate classroom course & exam. Exam admin team poor at responding to emails and it's utterly impossible to speak to anyone right up until you publish a negative review. The customer service is disappointing. Went through the full process with them, applied for a role, did multiple interviews and was told that I had the role. So I resorted to contacting the business who would have been taking me on as an apprentice who have also told me they had been cut off by QA.This isn't just days or weeks of being cut off now it's been months. Unprofessional teachers, worse training programme ever. Was appalled by anti Irish racist commentary and aggressive teaching style. \n",

It been an amazing experience working with one of the most popular EdTech company i.e. Whitehat Jr. You get the benefit of deciding your working hours, to teach students from different part of the world now. Teaching kids is really very good.. The best online platform for women to work and become self dependent, great support, the concierge, the RM, the Mentors.... They all seem to be really helpful and supportive WhiteHatJr is a great platform for WFH. This is a awesome work from home company which allows me to work as well as take care of my two kids Whitehatjr provides opportunities for engineers, pay is good and teacher can choose the work timings and the work environment is pleasant. WhitehatJr has been an incredible journey. Whitehat is great platform, my brother joined whitehat for the Applied tech curriculum and truly changed the way he thinks about things around him. \n",

      "Summary for WhiteHat Jr - bad feedback:\n",
      "The overall experience of WhiteHat Jr coding program is rated as average as the entire experience is dependent on the kind of teacher gets allocated to the student. Dont waste your money on this sham. I know so many people in US who have permanently blocked your number as they are scared of the non stop sale call. Although, they keep sending you endless marketing material, along with reminders of how amazing your child is, and how their ingenuity is in the 92nd percentile matching those of some famous personality... what a bunch of hogwash, just to keep your business. but this whitehat jr ad is just to promote their business . I have provided the emails and WhatsApp chat that I had with everyone at WhiteHatJr!-People the bottom line is that this coding platform is not for kids in the U.S.A period. My God..... there is no option to cancel the appointment, it's only a option delay to next day.comming calls are recorded and can't be answered. I could past the image of my whatsapp chat as proof if that functionality available hereNot sure how much time you guys (WhiteHat Jr) going to provide resolution on my issue, I had provided all the proofs along with screen for the above incident to Whitehat Jr in July, Aug and in Sept month. \n",
