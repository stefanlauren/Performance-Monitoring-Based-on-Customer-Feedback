4/10-FA app approved. Prompted to verify my ID 
4/11-attempted 64 times with different phones, tablets, PC to verify ID in daylight, inside light, LED light, etc FAILED-contacted support (ticket 2737097)-nothing they can do I must keep trying.
5/19-trying again to verify my ID. Tried dozens of times, even when on live Chat Help (ticket 2795238). FAILED. 
5/19-Carrie, from Coursera, advised me to send a picture of the errors I encountered, and I sent them. Carrie then advised me ""I was investigating on my end and it appears the issue you are experiencing is already a known problem on our end. Currently, I have reported the issue you are experiencing with the ID verification to our engineering team and they will be working as fast as possible to have this matter resolved."" then she assured me ""In this case, we have escalated the issue to our support team. They will be helping us to manually approve your ID verification. Please, give us a few more days to complete this verification for you.""
6/8, today-account still not verified and I am still unable to. 

Is the problem Persona? Is the problem Coursera? I have no idea but I know the customer service fails are Coursera (I have yet to find a CS number for Persona).

Only 1 person (probably admin and not a student) gave ""content is satisfactory"" feedback without ever reviewing my content.  I know that because my assignment was on a fileshare that alerts me when it's accessed. NOBODY ACCESSED IT.  So the grade was a scam.

It is like they have some random clips of training videos and stiched them together. The audio in places is like trying to listen to somebody over a bad phone line and combined with some accents you are unable to learn from these. The subtitles often come up with the wrong words or say uninteligable! The final exam is full of bugs, an example being you will be asked questions refering to an images however the image isn't there! Customer service don't care about you, don't reply and also the review system on the website is rigged for positive reviews.

There is also a major issue with having to complete 3 peer reviews when the learner is told repeatedly that there are no reviews available! Very frustrating. Finally, although I enjoyed this course and learned something, Coursera needs to be aware that there are many other excellent sources of online learning and if they want to maintain their reputation (or improve it!) they need to up their game and improve the content quality and accuracy.

They don't want to proceed with the refund even though their behaviour was unclear, misleading and definitely not transparent for any customer.

The website and app are easy to use. I never had any issues finding a course or completing one. There are discussion boards to ask questions and interact with the professors of your courses.

I’ve been using several sites to help build my CV and Coursera is by far the best. Everything is genuine and created by institutions you can trust, and you don’t have to pay for anything.

This is like a cashback industry that happened with mobile phones sometime back, they say at a future date if you send in the bills, you will get cashback, but most of us will not do it at a future date and the companies make money.  Similarly coursera makes money from people who forget to cancel the subscription on time.  May not be illegal, but deserves some disrespect for how they make money.  The primary way they make money is based on people forgetting to cancel the subscription and not for service delivery, hence bad reviews :(  If they want to have good reviews as well, they should take the card details only at the point where the students are really willing to pay on the spot.

The main issue so far is the peer review system - it is very frustrating

1) the questions themselves are poorly written e.g. One questions asked ""what form of control... "" not ""what forms of control..."" but the scoring required multiple forms - and this was born out by the 2 peer reviews I undertook - quite different answers and interpretation across all the questions.

The courses are highly variable in terms of quality, and the only skill you are guaranteed to improve is your cutting and pasting. However the customer support is where these scam merchants make their money. To sign up, you are forced in most cases to take a ""free 7-day trial"", it's not optional, and under their T&Cs, to continue the course, you must pay a £40 a month subscription. The trap ? Any subscription that starts with a free trial is subsequently non-refundable, so unless you finish the course in 7 days and cancel, your money's gone. This might not be a big deal, but multiply it by thousands of locked-in students and you can see where they make their money.

The problem arose for me after taking eleven out of twelve courses towards an IBM Professional Certificate. When I came to take the final one, I was informed that I had to choose a session to enroll on, but that there were no future sessions planned. I was told I couldn't have a refund as apparently my subscription had started with a free trial, and that future sessions, if any would ever take place, were outside Cousera's control, so I could keep paying and wait, or go f*** myself.

The content was fine, but the peer review assessment process was terrible. After spending a lot of time reviewing and providing written feedback to other learners, I did not get any written feedback. On my third assignment, there were technical issues and I couldn’t move forward in the course because I was unable to review anyone else’s work. So, my first two assignment marks were based on one peer review which was nothing more than another learning answering yes or no to a five question rubric. 

As well, there are no prerequisites for courses, so you never know what kind of peer feedback you will get, if you get any at all. With no feedback, it is very difficult to improve your work. I know a lot of work goes into creating courses, but without considered course delivery and implementation the course is little more than chunked information. And when it is a creative course, meaningful feedback is essential. 

I asked for a refund and was told that they don’t give refunds past two weeks. I was persistent and I did get a refund but they were not pleased to do so. They also refunded me less than what I paid, as they sent in Canadian funds what I had paid in US dollars. Sneaky. Money.

I didn't find any issues with pricing and grading system for as long as you know how to read and pay attention. The style of teaching is academically inclined to ensure you learn the concepts before application. You will have the opportunity to apply what you have learn through graded peer-to-peer assignments or capstone projects. As with anything else, you have to make sure that you try to diligently finish the course because it's not all the time that there will be enough students who will take up the course the same time as you do, especially that you can always reset your deadlines. To make sure that your work will graded in time, try to do your part as well to reach out to discussion/forums to ask for anyone to grade your work.

If you are actively using Coursera, you'll learn to appreciate how great the platform and courses are.

The second the payment came in, I rushed to see my subscription, only to realise it had never been cancelled despite me being sure I did it (guessing the cancellation didn't go through). Because I began the specialisation on a free trial, their policy states a refund is not possible, even though I have not used their services in the last month and cancelled the subscription (again) not 5 minutes after I was alerted of the new payment. Still trying to get my refund but my whole experience with coursera was a nightmare, from the format of their webpage (inconvenient to look at the lecture video and the transcript at the same time), to the quality of their lectures (extremely unengaging, constant stuttering and monotone), to the pace of their courses (they teach to crawl and then their exercises throw you in a pool and ask you swim). I'd accept it's a me issue if I were alone in this sentiment, but considering my partner learned all his coding skills online to switch careers and now has a job as a software engineer and even he dislikes this course the company asked him to take via this platform, I'm going to assume coursera has just stayed behind compared to other online resources.

- Sometimes they even put courses that can't be finished (because of broken assignments) and don't mention technical difficulties - for example Reinforcement Learning course from Advanced ML was impossible to finish for some time, and the only way to find that out was to read reviews and course forum.

In the past, I had to reject multiple works as they were just simply copied from the internet; even the names and dates were wrong in them, clearly showing that the source was Github and similar sites, not the students who were suppused to create them.

Even worse, when I do not give maximum points to assignments that do not work at all, then in revenge they give less points to me for work that give the correct results and this can be proven easily. I cannot even talk to the teacher to report this behaviour.

Finally, I am not happy about not being able to get a certificate for a course just because I waited too long to ask for it. They can easily see I have taken it, so why then?

When you leave this task up to the learners it becomes a real mess. As peoples reviewing skills vary widely. It's like asking someone to drive a car without a license. You just cannot predict the outcome. Because you have no idea what their past experience is. That's just crazy. And I would not trust them behind the wheel.

There is a real fear in the course that work will not even be graded at all. Peer grading is just a way for the course to be a self sufficient money spinner. It's no way to educate people.

And it's not good value for money. (e.g. I paid almost $1,000 for my course) And I may fail because a stranger decided they don't like me or my work. Or they just could not be bothered scoring my work. Even though I would easily pass from a real teachers point of view.  On the plus side people can pass easily with minimum effort.  If their peer reviewer is too kind. It's the luck of the draw. Here in the wild west.

It's an extremely lazy and money grubbing way to do things. Sorry to tell you. But you fail Cousera. For not turning up to class. I am not a professional reviewer or educator. So this review may be unfair. Just like the ones in your courses.

PS. Thanks Trustpilot for spreading the word.

PPS. Finished the course. While peer reviewing the final assignment. I noticed 2 students cheating. They simply linked to another student's website and said it was their own.

I contacted their customer chat bot, was connected to a CSR, and asked for a refund. I was immediately given their ""policy"" - that after a free trial no refunds are given.  This policy is to get you to accept the money has left your account and into their coffers.    

It took me quoting, as a UK resident, the UK Statutory rights, for them to make a ""one off exception"" to the rule and provide me with a full refund. If you are in the UK, please make sure to quote your statutory rights and do not accept their ""policy"" as it's not compliant with consumer protection. 

Oh, and as they're distance selling, if you've been charged and it's past your 14 day statutory rights, Coursera doesn't advise you of your rights on the website and therefore your right to request a refund is automatically extended to 12 months.  

Additionally, it’s ""illegal to display any notice that deliberately misleads consumers or deceives them about their rights, eg a sign that says you don’t accept returns or offer refunds"".",Person,,Alex,https://uk.trustpilot.com/users/5be575885483f4b8a98ea603,Thing,Coursera,Organization,Trustpilot,https://uk.trustpilot.com,Rating,1

Worse, we were told that we'd be informed via email as soon as other projects are available for review which never happened. 

Whenever I posted on the forum, a mentor would reply a few days after with a vague response about how having peer reviews are helpful but nothing about how that makes the certification even credible.

Worse, you have to keep requesting for people to review your work. I saw other people begging for reviews because they needed the certification asap. I don't think that's how it's supposed to work.

The website offers thousands of courses from fields varying from Teacher Development to Medicine. The duration, requirement, work load, syllabus and marking for each course is readily available. However, very few of those courses are available in languages other than English.

There is also a paid option where you get an official certificate of completion. 

The courses offered are through accredited universities from all over the world. It is so incredible that anyone can take these classes for free. If you haven't already checked it out and taken a class, I highly recommend that you sign up for one today!",Person,https://user-images.trustpilot.com/544019d400006400019097e2/73x73.png,Nikki,https://uk.trustpilot.com/users/544019d400006400019097e2,Thing,Coursera,Organization,Trustpilot,https://uk.trustpilot.com,Rating,5
198,Review,2013-05-09T12:10:32+00:00,The Future of Education is here,en,"Over the past half year I have followed five courses on Coursera, and they have all been of excellent quality. Pretty much all courses are made and run by recognized professors from well-known universities around the world.

In fact, I would gladly pay a small amount to take these courses, but they are completely free for anyone, which is quite amazing.

There are literally hundreds of different courses to choose from, ranging from computer science to engineering to social sciences. It would be truly strange if you could not find a course that you find interesting here.

I would say that one Coursera course corresponds roughly to half of one high-level university course. There is some homework involved if you want to get a cerficate of completion, but fortunately Coursera students help each other a lot in the forums (there is an online forum for each course).

You can also just choose to watch the lectures, and not do the homework, if your time is limited.

Coursera cannot be recommended highly enough for those of us who want to keep improving their knowledge of the world and/or get new skills for our jobs. This style of learning suits me better than a real-life university, since with Coursera you can easily review lectures on video as many times as you need.

Just be sure to start easy and don't take too many courses at once (as I did), or you may find yourself a bit overwhelmed by the workload.

I will continue to take many courses on Coursera, that is for sure.",Person,https://user-images.trustpilot.com/4ffb016000006400011cd704/73x73.png,Bjørn Bang Nielsen,https://uk.trustpilot.com/users/4ffb016000006400011cd704,Thing,Coursera,Organization,Trustpilot,https://uk.trustpilot.com,Rating,5
