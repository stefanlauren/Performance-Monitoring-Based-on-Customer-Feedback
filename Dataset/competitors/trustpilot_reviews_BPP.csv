2,Review,2020-12-15T16:39:45+00:00,I echo all of the negative comments about BPP,en,"I echo all of the negative comments about BPP. They truely are the most awful, rude and unprofessional pile of shysters you could ever wish to deal with.

They only ever contact you when they want money. They are very good at that. Call them about enrolment and the phone is answered immediately. The trouble is, once they have got you they don't care about you and treat you with contempt. They had cases of Covd-19 before they admitted one in February March. Why they only admitted to having one when there was more was the buzz. They even took that announcement of the one case down. I think it is because they don't care at all about students.

The teaching is so poor it makes you thank all the properly trained teachers you had a school and proper university. The ones I saw at BPP mumble, have sketchy knowledge of the subject area taught, make constant political judgments and comments, write illegibly on the board, concentrate on only a few favourites, do not involve the whole group. They show no interest at all, presumably because they don't care. The point someone made about only looking at students those with a training contract is exactly right. They get all the attention.

If you think about it, it does make sense. They are not teachers, tutors or lecturers by profession and the ones I saw no longer practice what they are teaching (if they ever did practice it). It is of little wonder the teaching is so poor.

The administration is scornful of students. They rarely answer the phone and if they do they pass you on to someone else.  I know the one about making payment for them to stop you going to class because of an administration error. You miss weeks of class and they do not believe you even though you havehad the money taken from your account. There is no apology.

The notes are a mish-mash of different authors adding bits here and there over the years. That is how they read. Elements repeated and changing styles throughout. English language is incomprehensible in parts (those EU notes!).

The online tutorials are OK in parts, it is easy to see who cares about providing some quality. The trouble is that the quality ones are the exception. Voiced over power points is the low bar most achieve but a good deal don't even get there.

BPP should be avoided. Good for masochists who like to be belittled and treated like scum by peopole who think they are special, but not so good for people wanting a professional qualification delivered by professionals.",Person,,SammiR,https://uk.trustpilot.com/users/5f2d339201ba9aaf73057c6a,Thing,BPP,Organization,Trustpilot,https://uk.trustpilot.com,Rating,1

Complete cash-grab: no focus on the individual, extremely limited opportunities for feedback, very average careers service. Exams are a joke. Tutors do not care. My undergraduate was at a top-2 university in the UK and the difference was absolutely shocking. You pay upwards of 13k for a load of printed notes.

Do not self-fund the GDL unless you have a genuine chance at getting a Training Contract. Be honest with yourself. BPP give false hope to students (inc. letting students with a 2.2 onto the course, who have almost no chance of getting a TC at any City firms). When these students almost inevitably don't secure TCs before the end of the GDL, they relentlessly market the LPC to get them to pay even more.

12,Review,2020-08-21T07:59:02+00:00,BPP ACCA Apprenticeship,en,"I have been training with BPP for nearly 2 years. I was going to wait to write my review after the full 3 years but I have lost all patience.

I cannot fault the tutors in any way - they are extremely helpful and willing. I haven't had any struggles with regards to my learning.

However, the customer service is poor and extremely frustrating. 

There have been a few times where i have rang customer service where they have been helpful, but it always seems to be on my second attempt after another member of the team has not done their job properly.

I feel I rarely have a course experience that has gone smoothly with regards to customer service, I even had issues being enrolled onto the apprenticeship in the first place, as they 'lost' my application, so I missed out on my first possible quarter of exams.

My law exam didn't get booked when i requested it. I had emailed in to book to the correct email address, where they informed me that I should email a different address. From here I had confirmation that they had booked the exam but i never received the booking documents that are usually sent. I then rang customer service who said that I had emailed the wrong email address and should have emailed the first address which is why it never got booked, even though I had emailed that address in the first place.

There has been another occasion where i emailed in and didn't get a response after 2 weeks.

I have had a number of calls to customer service where they have been rude and unhelpful, and in one case I was told an issue would be rectified, I rang again a few days later (a lovely lady answered) and she informed me that the previous call handler didn't even log an issue in the first place.

I have had issues with access to my hub account, which have taken 2 weeks to sort, which meant i was 2 weeks behind on my course as i had no access to learning materials; however they refused to move me to a course which had a later start date, so I have been unable to qualify for pass assurance.

On a number of times I have telephoned due to an urgent matter i have been told to 'email in with urgent as the reference and it will get sorted today' and then when I finally have a response two days later, I am told I should have rang in instead of emailed because they cannot respond to urgent emails quick enough.

I have been emailed the incorrect dates for my current revision course, which I am now unable to attend one of the days because of this.

They are extremely slow in marking the 'Step 4 and 6' which are meant to aid your learning and give feedback to help you improve your written answers. The idea is that you have feedback from Step 4 before you do Step 6, but I have even waited until after the Step 6 deadline and my Step 4 still hadn't been marked.

Overall, I wish it would be simple enough to change apprenticeship providers because trying to deal with customer service at BPP is extremely stressful and makes my whole experience completely unenjoyable.",Person,,Tori,https://uk.trustpilot.com/users/5f3f7ec05d4afc55bd9bd094,Thing,BPP,Organization,Trustpilot,https://uk.trustpilot.com,Rating,1
13,Review,2020-08-08T20:28:00+00:00,ACA courses at BPP,en,"To anyone reading this review I was hoping it would give you some insight into how my experience studying for my ACA exams at BPP has been. I have had to use BPP as my company had insisted and pretty much forced me to use them. I would say my experience at many times has been far worse than the 1 star given. I would encourage students, especially at the later stages of the exams to look at other training providers instead. For students booking themselves onto their courses, look out for their terms and conditions if you do book courses with them as they can be quite unfavourable. 

There have been times during my ACA where I actually found myself paying money out of my own pocket on additional resources and teaching materials from other training providers (especially for the later exams) to top up the gaps in BPP's training materials. For example for my Corporate reporting exam, the audit and assurance section of the exam was given very little time in the taught phase of the course and was pretty much ignored. This actually accounted for 30% of the exam. I bought a book from another learning provider that actually helped me get through this but if it wasn't for that text book I would have failed. There were also many other parts of the course that were overlooked, this has happened with other courses too at BPP I have been on at BPP. 

In terms of feedback for exams, this is always been extremely poor and they always get back to you late or not even in time, so there has been occasions when I haven't even received a mock feedback back despite submitting it on time. Also, the level of feedback you get at times can be extremely poor and therefore you have to request the mock team to get it remarked so the feedback provided is actually useful. Which takes even more time and there is always a risk you may never get this second feedback due to how poor BPP is run operationally. 

To anyone doing ACA exams and thinking of studying with BPP, especially towards the later or more harder ACA exams, I would strongly advise you to not use BPP. The tutors are helpful, nice and really do know their stuff but there is only so much they can do. They are tutoring so many different courses that it is difficult for them to get back to you with queries. I would encourage students if they have the chance to, to look do further research on other training providers, who may be able to give you much better support in preparation for your exams. My overall experience has been very negative and the learning experience I had with BPP is been by far the worst I have ever experienced. The only highlight has been that tutors do actually want to help you but the way the courses are set up and the operational activity that goes behind outweighs this one good thing greatly. Customer service/ management experience has also consistently been extremely poor.

As a further edit to this post : Please do not give much thought to the concern raised by BPP below. I have raised these concerns previously on countless occasions directly to them. I do not normally leave negative reviews but given how poor BPP have been and the fact I would want other ACA students to have a much better experience throughout their studies, I felt compelled to leave a review giving my honest thoughts. The exams are very tough and of course with this comes stress but studying with BPP doe at times add to this stress as opposed to helping mitigate this through good preparation.",Person,,ITG,https://uk.trustpilot.com/users/5f2f0abf83e7cc28a22dfaa0,Thing,BPP,Organization,Trustpilot,https://uk.trustpilot.com,Rating,1

I have tried to find out some details about their Cima books before I decide to buy them or not but after hours spent on the phone with their assistants I have been passed from pilar to post with the promise of a definite response which has not come yet even though many further emails and calls have followed to chase this.

Unfortunately there are only 2 publishers for the CIMA study materials, this one and Kaplan's. Kaplan's offers much more content in their books for a similar price (practice questions, mock assessments and free extra practice question resources in their online pages) but they have very poor scientific rigour and thus are littered with errors, omissions and contradictory theory at times.

Mainly because theyâ€™re thieves. 

Back to the course first:
Video Teaching materials that were uploaded online were poor quality. 
When requesting further assistance or clarity, I was told to just look at the lectures and work books again? Or they repeated whay was in the work books lol-Clearly they werenâ€™t helping in the first instance! 

Studied part time and there were slots per seminar. They rush through the material. 

Now onto why theyâ€™re thieves. I enrolled then deferred and eventually withdrew my place. When I deferred I had paid all my fees up to date and never re-enrolled and decided i want to withdraw my place. 

I was told I have to enroll a month before Iâ€™m due to come back which I never did. They enrolled me without confirming with me I wish to return. Whereas in the previous year they had emailed to ask it I was returning - which I declined and deferred another year. 
Few weeks later I get a call telling me I owe them Â£1200? Apparently Iâ€™m not the only one theyâ€™ve done this to. So my advice would be donâ€™t apply here. You withdraw your place then they come up with some extra charges.
