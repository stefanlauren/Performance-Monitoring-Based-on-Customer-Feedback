In fact it says on their website we cannot contact them other than email.  I got in touch with someone from the NHS as this is an NHS course being run by Future Learn, who in turn got someone from Future Learn to send me an email.  I replied, but have heard nothing since.

However, I am retired, hold two doctorates in my own fields and have no need of professional advancement. It seems that those who perhaps need reasonably priced access to courses that will help them professionally are not receiving what they need or expect - I say this because of the experiences of family members, not from the perspective of other people commenting here.
So, Future Learn suits me perfectly, but perhaps not everyone else. I noticed the information about being able to download a certification on one course I took came at the end of all the work put in, not early on. Busy, working people with children can't necessarily afford time to complete courses they then have no proof of having done. On the other hand, it would be easy for anyone to scroll through, click to say they had completed units they hadn't read and then award themselves a certificate, so perhaps a written piece needs to be submitter first, which would inevitably involve cost, but then, this is a business!",Person,,Jenni L,https://uk.trustpilot.com/users/6034bbaebebbb0001aa82254,Thing,FutureLearn,Organization,Trustpilot,https://uk.trustpilot.com,Rating,4

Initally, I gave a lot of benefit of the doubt but as time goes, I really regret using this platform. There are two parts: Co-ordinator outside of the course, educators or facilitators in the course.

Co-ordinator
- Never response back (if they respond, you might have followed up a minimum 10 times)
- lack of structural communication and accountability 

Educator
This part is crucial.
The way Futureture learn works; 
Course developed by somebody (University cannot confirm)
And educators are just facilitators.

I found that educators are
- not prepare enough to understand where the course goes
- hosting webinar only, no structure, no approach, and strategy on how to get the final output.
- not involved in quality of output and content

These are heads up for you. I previously did such courses in other platforms, my experience, I really regret signing up the course.",Person,,Ronny Kywe,https://uk.trustpilot.com/users/5f3f81aa5d4afc023e9bd2db,Thing,FutureLearn,Organization,Trustpilot,https://uk.trustpilot.com,Rating,2

Paid for a course did it and passed test. First you have to go through Id verification otherwise your certificate will say the I'd has not been verified. Second my certificate says ....

the award of credit or the conferment of a qualification from University
of Leeds and National Institute for Health Research''...the course was clearly by NIHR and University   if Leeds I was not warned or told about this .. Is there any value in this certificate?

Look at this from Futurelearn; 
 
Is FutureLearn accredited?
All certificates state the minimum number of hours required per week and the length of the course, so you can claim that many hours of CPD (Continuing Professional Development) by showing your employer or organisation the certificate.

The majority of learners who purchase them add them to their CV, but it's important to note that certificates do not imply the award of credit points or the conferment of a university qualification.

Where a course or program is accredited this information will be included on the course  .... this is from futurelearn website.

I paid 62 pounds for a non accredited course!!! 
If you want knowledge and scroll courses free.....it may be good for you otherwise it's a ripoff. Unfortunately if YOU HAVE TAKEN THE TEST OR RECIEVED  A DIGITAL  / ORIGINAL PAPER CERTIFICATE you can not claim back the money!!!!
