But alas, futuresque black wizardry such as being able to to watch a bleedin' video on your TV, seems to be outside their current frame of ambitions. 

On top of that, they just say Chromecast ""may not"" be available for ""some courses"" but how the dancing jesus do they expect the customers to find that out... Should I register to udemy, buy a course, find that chromecast is completely errattic, and just go oh, thats probably one of those course that do not work and cancel the class I was about to take.

Support are relatively responsive and kind, and do what they can with the cut/paste utter nonsense scripts their supervisor are providing them with, but it shouldn't hurt anyone to just take a moment and read the case, and just for a second reflect on the relevance of the suggestions they forward to the customer. 

Pricing and discount policy does not seem to be honest or in any way balanced. I was on Udemy for a couple of months, and i believe there has been 4 or 5 ""SALES"" with heavily discounted prices. 

I would be absolutely furious if I was a new Udemy user that had purchased a course at full price, only to see during the coming months, that 90% sales was more the standard than an exception. It's obvious that the full prices only exist as a psycological offset to make the discounted prices look like a bargain.

Technical quality also varies. Had to refund a course because the audio was overdriven and not adjusted through a long line of chapters. How can the instructor not check and notice this ? No QA from Udemy?

Udemy will not work if you use a VPN or attempt to access their courses from an IP which is not the IP you initially created the account from.

I explained to them that due to the cyclical nature of my source IP I will be unable to use Udemy and requested a refund. Their support do their best to ignore what you are telling them and tell you to log in to request a refund, which I cannot do.

When I ask support staff to help, they claim I can only login through the original device/browser, and that I needed to make sure I had never cleared the browser cache/cookies.

When I explain that the original device is a laptop with a broken screen. They just copy and paste a response about waiting 8 hours and attempting to login from the original device.

They also ignore my requests for any kind of refund.

They look like a legitimate company, but essentially their website is broken (or at least severely limited) and they don't appear to have any competent tech support staff who will do anything besides copy and paste a standard response.

I strongly suggest you don't fall into this trap! I feel like my money has been effectively scammed. If their site is broken they should at least offer a refund.

The site is clearly set up so that you can't actually contact anyone. Their (email) support only aims to respond within 1-2 days.

Avoid using this service! It might seem like it works, but only until you login, once, from a different browser. Then your account is unusable and you get stuck in this loop.

I've completed 30 hours of nutrition courses and am taking a beginning chemistry course which will add another 30 hours to my coursework. 

Some professors give tests but most don't. It's more than just videos most have downloadable pdf resources. When you finish a class there's a trophy looking thing that says ""get certificate"" it ask if you want to download as an jpg or pdf.

I have bought 18 courses and I am having trouble with some of them. My Spanish skills are not that good but I am attempting to learn, same with chemistry and algebra. But that's more on me than them. Most the nutrition are taught either by doctors or Registered Dietitians.

I don't think the certificates are transferable for college credit, but some of my classes were internationally accredited and the instructor will give you instructions on how to get that diploma which involves taking a screenshot of your completed course. 

I do think the information is useful though. Some of the classes are college level and will prepare for a college. I think, in a way, they are more economical than Alison. At Alison the classes are free but you have to pay for your certificate. And who knows if it will ever get to you by mail. My biggest problems with Udemy are 1) I'm running out of room on my computer to download the many wonderful resources and 2) I'm running out of ink in my printer. 

There is one class where I couldn't get the test to move on. I checked to make sure my answer was marked. It didn't tell me if my answer was right or wrong, and wouldn't let me move on to the next question.

2nd point) Yes, its very easy to get refund. All you have to do is press, right click on the top menu when you are on the course and click on ""Request Refund"" and fill the form and money comes to your account. The money came to my account. There was no problem. 

3rd point) Those people that say they only refund credits, well they are not that clever are they, went you request the money, they give you two options .request credit or refund (its right below request credits option).

4th point) ait is not expensive if you know how the model of Udemy works.  Every few days they bring down the prices (I know they say discount ends soon, but its just marketing tacktic). You just have to search it everyday and you will find discounted price atlesst 5 days every 2 weeks.",Person,https://user-images.trustpilot.com/5fc7aa150a6ce00019bff4a9/73x73.png,Nouer Uz-Zaman,https://uk.trustpilot.com/users/5fc7aa150a6ce00019bff4a9,Thing,Udemy,Organization,Trustpilot,https://uk.trustpilot.com,Rating,5

There's almost always a sale so you can expect to pay about £13 for life time access to each course. There is a fair amount of rubbish on there but an awful lot of awesome content too. I've had a few really bad courses that I've requested (and been given) a refund for. By far and away the best value training and once you find some instructors you trust and gel with it's fantastic. The website and apps for android and ios are just fine and you get a certificate of completion for LinkedIn as well. I genuinely think if you're prepared to put in the effort you'll get every bit as much out of some course here as you would from companies selling live taught courses at 100 times the price you'll pay on Udemy.,Person,https://user-images.trustpilot.com/51f67715000064000145b283/73x73.png,Andre Russell,https://uk.trustpilot.com/users/51f67715000064000145b283,Thing,Udemy,Organization,Trustpilot,https://uk.trustpilot.com,Rating,5

I gave up now and I have called my lawyers, this is utterly stupid and unbusinesslike and robbery.
1- I spent time with at least a dozen emails re: merged account.
2- after this I continued to have problems with my login details, they would forget my passwords ....then they would not allow me to reset the password...since no emails were sent for the reset?!!
3- IT IS VERY DIFFICULT TO FIND AN EMAIL TO CONTACT THEM THAT WORKS ..PLUS WHEN YOU TRY TO EMAIL ON THEIR SITE ...IT LINKS SOMEWHERE ELSEWHERE on their fill in (no email tracking is possible etc) and or  YOU NEED TO BE LOGGED IN??  THIS IS MANIPULATIVE CRAP. WHEN THERE THEY PRETEND THERE IS AN EMAIL..IT SENDS YOU TO FILL OUT A FORM ON THEIR SITE.  
And i have paid courses on their site? Makes no sense.
This is so stupid and abusive considering 20 courses were paid ...so i started asking for a refund for most recent courses and also ASKED FOR A TOTAL REFUND OF ALL MY COURSES WHICH PROBABLY IS ABOUT 600.00 US currency
THIS COMPANY IS VERY STUPID OR THEY ARE THEIVES. Since i have even tried too to communicate with an old email re: i was having too many problems and 2- wanted a refund 3- also told them i would call cops...BUT NOTHING HAPPENED?!

The important thing when using them is to wait for their sales which are very regular, and to read reviews on the courses you want to take.

So I reached out to customer service asking for a refund or an offset credit against the other course and was pointed to a refund policy which says that refund may not be allowed if a ""significant chunk of the course has been consumed""

So I asked the customer support whether 10% classifies as a significant chunk and the answer was yes!

There is lack of transparency about the refund policy at the time of marketing these courses on the site ans stuff like this should be highlighted properly.

When I contacted Udemy to ask what was going on I was told that they run promotions - however if they just make up prices then promotions are of little consequence.

As an example, I took a course that claimed to be a ""complete"" web development course. The reality is that it was a somewhat decent introductory course, but was missing so much that to claim to be ""complete"" is grossly overstating things. Nothing at all on front or back end frameworks, nothing on build tools, no mention even of version control! That said, when the courses cost in the region of £10 - 15, even the basic ones are not too bad for complete beginners. My biggest gripe with the platform however is the pricing. On occasion I see courses in the range of £10 - 15, only to then see the price go up to £199.99 once I've signed into my account, ready to buy the course. Typically, if you wait, there'll be a period during which the price will come down, and you may be able to get the course for around £10 - 20.

As someone already wrote down here, how on earth there are negative reviews? I may tell you why... but first my review!

I cannot thank Udemy enough for the excellent platform, and probably for the reason why I can keep my job in this current crisis having learnt fundamental skills to make me more essential for my company a very competitive prices, as they can count on total revenue with high volume and I assume some form of reward to tutors based on popularity. The platform is excellent, only one downside is FIX YOUR DOWNLOAD AS EVERYTHING IS CALL ORIGINAL FOR THE PAST TWO MONTHS!!! Here we go that is my downside for this platform.

Courses are various and it is up to you to read the reviews and ensure it fits your need, I had to refund two courses as they were not exactly what I was looking for, one I was 80% through it and they refunded it no question asked, on 20 courses I refunded only two.

Now for the dumb down here talking about OFFICIAL ACCREDITATION, this is a private learning platform, common sense dictate that they are not official as such but you can prepare for any official accreditation, if needed, eventually on the job market what matter is what you can do and what's on your CV anyway.

Also certain things are relevant for each course only, such as response time from a tutor, so far I got all courses where tutor replied in more than excellent time (hours not days) and what I learned in the subject I am following is priceless, i.e. a 3D course in London for a week is £900 (from) I got to a mid level user here for 1/100th less, same with coding.

Prices: They are always on sale, consider the sale price as normal however really some courses are worth the asking price not on sale, it is incredible how they can achieve so low prices ensuring tutor Q&A Support for like a ridiculously dirty cheap price, we can just thank them to make everyone happy here, tutors and users.

Support so far has been helpful, except done for this two months lasting bug with the downloads naming. They are quick even during the pandemic, for refunds most of the time you don't need to speak to no one.

Video Quality: That's up to the tutors often, if they record 720p they record 720p, not much can be done... however all courses I have had are 1080p which is plenty for computer related courses.

Really this platform is a god send for anyone wishing to improve him/herself, one thing, when you take a course you pay for the course not to harass a tutor in the Q&A about your own bloody specific needs for your project, it  is not a consultancy firm, is a TRAINING, you learn you apply and you ask question related to the course, not your own job!!!

However, my negative review is about Udemy’s business practices, which in my view exploit existing loyal users by inflating prices. I’ll use the latest example of a stock trading course, which I’ve just purchased. When I googled the course, I found it advertised on Udemy for £13.99, which I thought was a very good price. This type of price is usually available when they have sales on, so I was happy to purchase the course. I followed the link and logged into my Udemy’s account, only to find out that the price had now jumped to £199 pounds with no explanation about the price difference. There was no reference to the fact that the cheaper price might only be available to new users or anything like that. I was just presented with the higher price and expected to complete the transaction, which I didn’t. At this point, I log out of my account and run the search again, but the price displayed is still £ 199 pounds. I thought that it could be because of cookies downloaded when I was browsing the Udemy’s site but clearing the browser cache didn’t fix the issue. I then tried to run the search from another computer, only to be presented again with the high price of £ 199 pounds. It then occurred to me that the Udemy’s system might now be using my home IP address to block me from seeing the cheaper prices on offer, regardless of what computer I was using.  At that point, I cleared the browser cache, connected to a VPN service, which changed my public IP address and run the search again. Guess what? The course was priced again at £13.99. I then just opened a new account in Udemy and purchased the course at the advertised price of £ 13.99.

192,Review,2020-05-10T23:50:51+00:00,I'm surprised by the overall negative…,en,"I'm surprised by the overall negative reviews, but after reading many individual ones, it seems some people either 1) Didn't take the time to learn or understand the platform, the return policy, etc, 2) Seem to expect a formal college type class for $10-$15, or 3) Were unhappy with a course and instead of rate the course in Udemy, they decided to blame Udemy as a whole. 

Udemy simply provides the platform for everyday people to house and sell their courses. Keeping in mind that we're often learning from average people with the skills or knowledge we want, I'm extremely happy with the Udemy platform. They often have sales, where we can get courses for $10-$15. (As long as the content creators participate in the sales. Those who don't usually get far less sales, so boo on them.) Keeping that in mind, the courses often exceed my expectations, and I feel I get more value than what I pay. That said, I would not buy courses that aren't on sale because they have sales at least once a month. 

I've gotten a couple of crap courses before, and like most others do, I give honest feedback and request a refund within the 30 day money back guarantee. Then I pay nothing for the crappy course, and the instructor doesn't get my money, pretty simple. Those who obviously rush to put crap on Udemy for a quick buck, they get run off pretty quickly, either from Udemy or due to a ruined reputation. Thanks to the consumers who leave negative reviews on the courses themselves. After all, it's the low quality instructors who deserve the bad rap, not Udemy. 

If you want a formal education or to be taught by licensed teachers, there's Coursera and many online college campuses. For several thousand dollars, you can get exactly what you're looking for! As for me, I'm happy to learn exactly what I want to learn at the moment, get in and get out for about $13. 

I've been a regular Udemy consumer for about 4 years now, and I own over a hundred courses. What's nice is you can easily discover who the high quality teachers are and which ones often update their courses. After all, once you purchase a course, you get lifetime access.

Feed that back on the course itself within Udemy.  Thats not the fault of Udemy.  The reviews within udemy are useful to get peoples feelings before you enroll or not.

The course 'The Complete Web Developer in 2020: Zero to Mastery' is currently showing as being £13.99 in the app with a 67% discount from £44.99.

I'm fully aware many instructor may not be very happy with their commission, as Udemy charges 50%+ for most of their courses. But for student this is a great alternative to 10 times more expensive rip-offs such as Pluralsight or CloudAcademy, to name just two.

For example they will offer you courses at a very low price (up to 94% off) if you have never registered an account. You can then buy literally as many courses as you want ALL for this discounted rate.

However after purchasing 1 or more courses in one go, you will never get courses for that kind of discount again.

They will show you courses for the same discount some weeks in the future but then when you go to the checkout, they will tell you that you aren't eligible and they will increase the price automatically, as literally all of their discounts are only ever for NEW customers.

Also they unfairly give some people discounts and others none at all. For example my girlfriend gets more discounts than I do for some reason despite us having the same number of courses purchased on our profiles. Why is it that she can get up to 94% off and I can only get 85% off. We are the same age, from the same location etc. So what's left... Sexism perhaps?

What-ever Udemy is using in order to calculate who should get discounts, it's totally unfair. The only way to fight back is just to make new accounts any time that you want to buy a course and take advantage of them just offering these discounts to ""new users"".

I'm really disgusted and honestly it just encourages people to get them from ""elsewhere"" for free. Udemy, you really need to clean up your act. Stop offering only ""new"" members these discounts. Don't offer new members 94% off but then offer your current members only 90% off and think that we are too stupid to notice, or won't care.",Person,,Dean,https://uk.trustpilot.com/users/5e1d99ee013d414c7f21ec56,Thing,Udemy,Organization,Trustpilot,https://uk.trustpilot.com,Rating,1

234,Review,2020-01-07T14:40:29+00:00,The courses are good but the company is unethical,en,"The website hosts decent courses. Every course I purchased worked successfully and I have learned a lot from the videos that I watched. I learned how to program in Java, and the web development boot camp course that I took was great, but I do not trust the company at all.

What ruins this site for me is the approach that the company takes with marketing its courses. It is dishonest and it tricks you into believing that what you are buying has a higher value, which inevitably puts pressure on the customer to buy as much as possible in the ""limited time"" that they have. I have spent about £200 because of this and two years later they still have a ""limited time deal"" on every time I check the website.

Especially since they use countdown timers and frequent use of slogans such as ""reinvent yourself"" which tricks you into believing your spending will be for the betterment of yourself, which inevitably removes any shred of doubt from your purchasing with a good justification.

There is always a ""mega sale"" happening, where every course on the website is dramatically reduced from £199.99 to just £9.99 for a ""limited time"". Not to mention that the course creators are independent to udemy, it is not the company that creates the courses, and taking from feedback posted on social media from a few creators, udemy completely rips off their profits.

There is also no verification that the creator is posting original content. There have been reports of creators creating courses out of other peoples YouTube videos and selling them on udemy to make money out of other peoples work.

I do not trust this company. Not because the courses are bad, or that they did not deliver what they said they would, but because of how devious they are with their marketing tactics.

I have been buying these courses for years now and I can honestly say that I have not been able to complete any of them to the way they're intended. Despite the extensive tutor work that seems to go into them I have found them to be almost  useless because what seems to work for the instructor simply doesn't work for the student.

If you tried to follow the instructions word for word, screen for screen you will find yourself unable to do so because tabs are missing, functions do not appear, error messages occur for no reason that can be addressed quickly and easily for any novice. To find answers you will have to go outside of the tuition framework in a hit and miss process that will often take you way outside the framework or scope of what is being taught. You will often end up working with a totally new version of what your'e trying to learn, seeking new instructions that are again hit or miss. 

The only way to learn is with an instructor right there in front of you experiencing exactly what you're experiencing on the screen at the time it is happening for you. This way the theory and practice can come to together in a way a novice can learn. 

That way the tutor will have to fix the things happening (or not!) on the students screen in a way that.s relevant to the framework of what s(he) is trying to teach: not several advanced levels above to fix the problems with the lesson that completely spoil the experience by the time the student has got to it.",Person,,Akin,https://uk.trustpilot.com/users/588204ce0000ff000a6e8453,Thing,Udemy,Organization,Trustpilot,https://uk.trustpilot.com,Rating,3

263,Review,2019-09-24T14:29:33+00:00,I wish I could give this company 0…,en,"I wish I could give this company 0 star. I have been an Instructor on this platform for 6 months now, just providing free sample courses to students who are interested in my area and want to learn it. I have my own website and sell courses on there without Udemy and have been quite successfully too, but thought I'd try Udemy to see if this made changes for me and brought in new students. 

Unfortunately, the quality of students is poor. A lot of students enrol onto courses and do not do the work including assignments or downloadable work and many do not even watch all of the video lessons. Many are, quite frankly, ""lazy"" students who think that being spoon fed is the only way to learn anything. These students exist in Universities too and our school classrooms, but they seem to be bred on Udemy. 

For Udemy to then allow these same lazy students to actually rate and leave a comment for Instructors on their courses especially when they have not taken even a third of the classes or done any assignments, is beyond ridiculous! Students complain about free courses, free resources, free anything... these are the same poor quality students who would not thrive in normal life and real classrooms. 

I'm sorry to say but Udemy is not a place to learn, but a popularity content amongst students who want to be entertained and be spoon-fed and not actually do any of the work or learning. I think Udemy suits Instructors who are similar to their students, who do not have a real speciality and can somehow entertain students with their ""knowledge"". There are few exceptional experts in their fields on this platform but they are very rare - other than that you are really just learning from any old person off the street who decided to create a course and I am embarrassed to have my course on there. 

I am now trying to pursue Udemy to get my course off there because I feel embarrassed to have my name associated with this cheap ""school"". Furthermore, Udemy never provide accurate and timely reports on student and course status. For example, when I reached 1000 enrolled students, they sent an email then to tell me by first student had enrolled... very delayed and just poor all round service with a poor looking site and ""old"" feel. Their rules for ratings is ridiculous. For example, I had students leave comments like ""excellent course"" but with a 1-star rating, which is clearly the student mis-clicking the star rating they actually wanted to give, or just being lazy. This happens A LOT, and despite complaints to Udemy, Udemy themselves are too lazy to do anything about. The reason this affects Instructors is because this obviously affects the overall star-rating on course as a whole. For a course that's completely free, and I am making absolutely no money from it, all this headache and damage to reputation is not worth it. 

My main issue has been this unfairness around course ratings. A good school or university would never allow a student to pass or move on to another module on a course without completing prior modules, let along rate the school! Only good thing about Udemy is their chat service - they have good support staff on the other end who try their best and respond pretty quickly.

I advice anyone who truly cares and respects teaching their field and has been thinking about using Udemy... please stay clear of it. I give it a few more years before it gets the official stamp of being a dumping ground for both poor quality students and courses!

Udemy promotes and pushes the same courses over and over, so if you teach in an area that already has a couple of good-selling courses, YOUR course will never be on top of the list or in the suggestions.
Students can be vile. I have seen people signing up only to give instructors a bad rating, competitors or people with personal issues, then they disappear again, after they completely killed a new course of a professional person, who spent months on creating that course, and gets maybe 2.50USD per sale.
It's ridiculous! Students buy courses for 10 USD and then they expect 24/7 instructor support, having all their questions answered and then they can't even be arsed to give that instructor a good rating.
Students also don't read the course instructions and then give a bad rating because the course is supposedly ""too basic"" or ""too advanced"". They give 1 or 2 star ratings simply because they cannot read and practically destroy the course with their rating. Because once you are below 4.5 stars, nobody is going to buy your course anymore.
I have seen a few courses of very experienced professionals, that were well done and offered exactly what was described in the course introduction. And yet, people leave 1 star-reviews and complain.
Unbelievable how many entitled spoilt brats are out there.
And the problem is, instructors need 5-10 good reviews to make up for a bad one. Udemy cares not about any of that, they just collect the money. 
So if you are an instructor and want to invest 3-6 months of full-time work so you can get some pocket money for a take-away dinner each month, then Udemy is the place for you.",Person,,Frau B.,https://uk.trustpilot.com/users/59e2f0160000ff000ad51c8b,Thing,Udemy,Organization,Trustpilot,https://uk.trustpilot.com,Rating,3

These platforms for selling courses should at least vet the course so it is not spurting out free stuff for sale! A valuation of £199.99 is ridiculous for free content. Sellers should be made to sign a declaration that their content is NOT freely available to the public.

Another point is that Udemy periodically sells courses at the 'original' price for a few days, which I think is so it can claim huge savings, and stay within legal selling policies, when in fact the courses are NORMALLY sold for less than 20 of whatever your currency is.
Oh yes, its flat pricing is odd in my view. I'm not sure how the same course can be $20 USD and £20 GBP, when exchange rates and taxes would make those costs different for the same turnover.

Clear your browser cookies or use different browsers for courses and browsing what to buy, just to make sure that you see the latest normal-price fake sale.

I would ignore the course ratings as Udemy reminds learners to rate the course after the first lecture, which is really not a good indicator of how good the whole course is. It then goes on to nag you after every few lectures to rate again, and again, and again. You can tell the site to stop reminding you until the end of the course, but I wonder how many reviews are based on completing less than 15% of the courses. I have read many reviews themselves, and sometimes the review complains about something that is addressed later in the course.

On a positive note, Udemy does offer a 30-day money-back guarantee in case you are not satisfied, and the range of courses is vast.

I like that Udemy is NOT a subscription site, as I have not purchased enough courses to equal the value of a few month's of some sub. sites costs. Subscription sites may claim lifetime access, but what happens if you stop paying? Yes, no access.

To summarise, 
* Check the tutor's YouTube channel first
* Another fake sale is just around the corner, so don't be pressured to buy now
* Clear browser cookies
* Carefully consider the reviews and ratings
* 30-day guarantee

The content on the courses I've done has been really good, and I've even started using what I've learned in my daily work life, which has been great - I've been getting a lot of recognition from seniors regarding my work.

My only gripe would be that they appear to have a sale on all the time - If the courses really are that expensive, then why can't they just be reduced in price permanently? It almost comes across as a a marketing ploy to make it look like you're getting an even better deal - Plus, I'd be pretty annoyed if I had bought something at full price, only to see it being reduced to £10 a few days later. That's not really nice.

303,Review,2019-01-08T18:52:24+00:00,I've been using Udemy for a while now…,en,"I've been using Udemy for a while now and I've had a reasonably positive experience. The cost of the courses really was the first thing to attract me to the website and then the delivery; watch whenever you want, learn whenever you want - sounds perfect. I have progressed my learning thanks to Udemy. The whole concept of being able to move around in your daily life and have a full comprehensive course (if you find the right one) at the touch of your fingertips without necessarily having to download anything or carry around a backpack full of books is amazing. I've been able to learn just by loading up Udemy on my phone and expand my knowledge simply by pressing a few buttons on my phone. 

That being said, the delivery of this concept needs a lot of re-tweaking in my personal opinion. 

PRICING METHODS
- The first negative aspect of Udemy is the pricing methods. I signed up initially for a course which cost around £12.99 and additionally bought another as part of an offer, believing I had saved some money. A few weeks later, both courses were some £3 cheaper and so I had actually spent more on the supposed 'deal' than if I had bought them separately, exclusive of the deal, a few weeks later. I then noticed the courses remained at this price for a few weeks before then rotating upwards from anywhere between the original price I paid and sometimes exceeding £100. This really confused me and it seemed shady. Why would you switch your prices up every few weeks? Other than to suck some people in with a seemingly good deal whilst charging others 20x the price those who bought the course weeks prior?

This strange pricing method impacted me some months later when I was offered a course for £9.99 and then asked at the checkout to pay £29.99. I messaged Udemy Support and was met by a quick reply stating that this particular offer was for new customers only, despite me being logged into my account at the time of seeing this supposed offer and Udemy obviously being aware I was not a new customer at all. She then proceeded to offer me the course at it's original price and I bought it. Since then, I've seen this pricing scheme cycle the prices of courses from £9.99 to £199.99 and then back down, all the while advertising 'sale' prices. It's clearly not a sale but merely a tactic to sucker some unlucky customers into paying just over 20x the usual price. I don't consider this fair practice. The price drop should be clearly advertised and the fluctuations made accessible to potential customers, so that they know the price they are about to pay is nowhere near how much the course will be only 7-14 days later.

LEGITIMACY OF COURSE CONTENT/TEACHERS
- The second issue with Udemy is the legitimacy of teachers. I've been studying under an education/teaching brand operating on Udemy whose background appears sketchy at times and other times completely suspect. It makes me think just how qualified some of these teachers actually are and potentially how damaging it may be to a potential learner who is hoping to seek a level of education relative to a recognized academic level. I believe no instructor is vetted on their credentials and so you could theoretically open up shop claiming to be a PhD in psychology whilst having never finished high school. The end result is a fraudulent money incentivized business and a platform which harbours charlatans and crooks. This particular teacher I have just discussed is not so bad and a majority of his teachings are verified in the academic literature I have myself decided to invest in as I'm very serious in progressing into a particular field at a later date and using Udemy as a 'stepping stone' to academic education. This issue also trickles down into the standards of the courses, some of which are like mentioned, far from the standards of even a basic introductory beginner course at your local college or school. I have joined courses whereby the additional content is not available to use in furthering your studying and as a result you are met with a 'This file cannot be found' or something very similar. How irritating. You pay for a course, you want to do coursework/homework and your teacher cannot bring himself/herself to maintain and provide the materials!

RELIABILITY
- A third is the reliability of software implemented at Udemy. Good luck trying to get the Android app to work 50% of the time. The Android app is the only experience I've had with a smartphone compatible app from Udemy and in my opinion, based off many years using Android phones and experiencing the quality of apps available, it's barely at the average standard by which you should expect well known reputable brands to be offering services on. The app regularly makes novice errors easily rectified such as replaying videos you've already watched, when in memory and the app reloaded from memory it will play a video you may have watched several hours ago or perhaps even days ago as it fails to catch up with your activity and progress on the course. Developing a simple app with a simple browser plugin built-in would make the app way better seeing as you would get the full site features and not a watered down basic version. Admittedly, the main website works much better, that being on a desktop computer and on the desktop it's nice to look at; smooth, simple and easy to use. The mobile browser website is barely functional and they have for some reason done the same with the mobile site as they have done with the mobile app and limited what you can do on the mobile version considerably despite a large portion of their audience enjoying courses from the comfort of their smartphones. I can't seem to easily navigate to course reviews or any of the extended website and that's baring in mind most smartphones nowadays come with quad core processors and relatively good resolution screens - why skimp out on the most important aspects of the site when most phones with decent specs are now so easily affordable?

Also I should mention the website runs really slow sometimes. Sometimes the slowness of the connection from the Udemy servers causes the quality of the video to skyrocket down to 144p which is annoying. This happens randomly and often stops me from studying as the quality is unbearable.

OVERALL
- A good concept with many ideas making Udemy a hit online education website, shame they haven't polished some of the rough edges off 
- Easy to access within reason and very simple to buy a course and get stuck in to something you really enjoy or want to enjoy learning about
- A massive range of courses with some really good teachers but at the same time, take the 'certification' courses with a pinch of salt as pretty much all of them have no recognized accreditation governing body behind them and those that do may not have the credentials in the education industry to reinforce the certification given and/or match up to recognized and accredited courses. I would use Udemy as a very basic stepping stone towards further education, assuming that no one course on Udemy will cement your knowledge and guarantee you a foot onto the ladder of your chosen field. Use these courses as an accessory/supplement and not to be used as bonafide evidence of completing a body of work recognized by regulating authorities
- WATCH OUT FOR THE STRANGE DRAMATIC PRICE FLUCTUATIONS! ONE MINUTE MY COURSE IS £9.99 AND THE NEXT IT'S £199.99! KEEP AN EYE ON THE PRICES AND MAKE SURE YOU GET IT AT THE PRICE IT USUALLY MAKES A FINAL DROP TO TO AVOID SPENDING WAY OVER WHAT THE COURSE WILL BE VALUED AT SOME DAYS OR WEEKS LATER

It's not like a traditional classroom where you have an instructor who can look over your shoulder and help you, but for an online class it's a lot of bang for your buck.

The  Bad......I saw that Udemy participates in Ebates. I clicked through Ebates and I found that Udemy's sites had automatically jacked up their prices to more than cover the Ebates discount, making it more expensive to use Ebates than not using the program. I'm sure the practice isn't illegal, but it is unethical and hopefully a contract violation with Ebates. It would probably be a good idea for Ebates to dump them.",Person,,Bruce,https://uk.trustpilot.com/users/5acd484f4de5666d34cd551e,Thing,Udemy,Organization,Trustpilot,https://uk.trustpilot.com,Rating,3

335,Review,2018-03-23T16:31:24+00:00,Skewed ratings system,en,"I signed up for a course that lasts for 30+ hours, and they ask me for a review after about 10 minutes! By this point in the material they hadn't even started the actual content of the course yet, they were still going on about ""how to get the most out of the material"", and all the usual intro stuff. They openly say they are penalized by Udemy if their course rating falls below 4.5 stars so they ask people to give them higher ratings - which most people do. It's a bit like if Amazon asked you to review a product before it had been delivered and was still in transit, or to review it based on the packaging it was delivered in.

This means you have no way of knowing when going into a course that will take many hours of your time, whether it will be worth it at all.

When you look through the ratings for a course, you'll find no-one that has actually completed the course reviewing it (at least not for the longer courses like the ones I have been looking at) - instead just giving a very early opinion of the course based on first impressions and if they ""like the presenter"". With course titles and descriptions that suggest you will be able to charge for your services once completing the course (like with a lot of the application development courses) there is an apparent lack of people that come back once they have completed the course and say""Yes, I did this, it was great because of ...., and I can now earn money doing...."".

I like the idea of the collection of online courses, and the one I am doing is ok, but the way they are manipulating the ratings to make it impossible for students signing up to the site to make an informed decision about what is a good course, is poor. 

Further more, the pricing system of ""4 days left at reduced price"" is a sham - courses offered at  £200 now £10 for a few days is a lie - the price varies depending on the device you browse from, evidently using cookies to push you into signing up.

All in all, this is not a service focused on getting talented trainers together with keen students and rewarding the best trainers and courses. Instead it is a business designed to push as many people to pay for courses as possible. Whether they get any value or not of them is another matter.",Person,,Jonathan,https://uk.trustpilot.com/users/5056fb8d000064000121bd7e,Thing,Udemy,Organization,Trustpilot,https://uk.trustpilot.com,Rating,2
336,Review,2018-03-21T22:47:11+00:00,"Not for everyone, play it by ear",en,"This website isn't for everyone. This review is based solely on the courses that I've paid for and the quality of the instructors that I've watched. I understand other people have had many customer service/payment/some headache on their end. I fortunately have not run into any trouble, so here's a perspective if you don't run into any problems like me. 

I've paid for a few basic photography, sketching, adobe cc, and sketch/java courses all on sale. To generalize my overall experience, it's been a pretty smooth experience buying and learning from the courses. The instructors I've watched are pretty helpful and they've taught me important foundational things as well as solid tips and tricks. 

Some instructors are from different countries, so they may have accents where you have to decipher their speech. Some instructors aren't as exciting to watch as others. Some instructors are very responsive when you have questions regarding the topic, and some aren't. 

 In the end, I can definitively say that I've gained a few skills from Udemy. Sure, it's not the most perfect learning tool, but sometimes you can gain little nuggets of information you wouldn't otherwise get from youtube. 

I would recommend this site because I don't find it to be a very expensive site for investing in your education. It's convenient, and you can pick up where you left off at any time. If you want to avoid some of the aforementioned headaches that other people have noted in their reviews, Lynda.com or Khan Academy are really good alternative sites for learning, depending on what you're aiming for.

I try not to overlap courses of the same topic, and I buy by ear by reading reviews and watching free samples from the course beforehand. The most helpful thing I can tell you to do, is wait for your course to go on sale, or have a promo code ready. There are only some courses I'd pay full retail, and others I would definitely not.",Person,https://user-images.trustpilot.com/5a86563bf675864e5602edfd/73x73.png,vince,https://uk.trustpilot.com/users/5a86563bf675864e5602edfd,Thing,Udemy,Organization,Trustpilot,https://uk.trustpilot.com,Rating,4

I did as requested, but the verification process failed without explanation. Note that I didn't originally agree this validation process.

I went through the alternate verification process (emailing them a video essentially claiming I was who I was) and received no response from Udemy.

I asked repeatedly for an explanation and/or instructions, but received no response from Udemy.

I have since cancelled my Lynda.com subscription because Udemy provides a much better platform for people to learn. Because you actually get to talk to your teachers, you have way more tutorials about your subject of interest to choose from and the customer service is superb.

There are no subscriptions, so once you're in a class, you can refer to it for as long as it is there. You also have 30 day refund policy. Plenty of time to engage with the course to see how you might like it.
I've been taking classes just over a year, and have found that the technology classes are updated, depending on the topic, and instructor.

After taking the first free class, it seemed to be similar to finding information anywhere on the web, but yet I was intrigued at how organized the information was and how much variation in what was taught.
I then looked at a few other classes and decided to take one that cost money. I was surprised at what was offered, how it was taught, and at a relatively inexpensive cost.
After that first class, I was hooked. I have taken several paid classes and have also taken several free classes over the years and must say that I have never been unhappy. Don't get me wrong, there have been a few free ones that I was glad were free once I started them, but overall I have not been disappointed.
I still have several classes left to take and several on my wishlist for the future, but being able to go at these at your own pace, when you want to work with them, and without any additional pressure, is great.

The app is great except for two minor issues:
1- This problem affects both the mobile and web apps: Once you enroll in a course, you can no longer easily see the initial course information page that you based your decision to enroll on. There is no way to see it again other than to log out and view the course page as a non-subscriber. There should be a link to see that page while logged into the app.
2- This problem is applicable only to the mobile app: If I turn off the screen of my Samsung Galaxy Note 4 while a course is playing, sometimes the course pauses and sometimes it does not and the audio keeps going on after the screen is off. I don't know the conditions leading to one happening or the other. I would like the option to control this behavior like with the Audible app. Sometimes I want to keep the audio going even while the screen is turned off, because it is primarily an audio-based course and I am doing something else and have the phone in my pocket while listening on my wireless earphones.",Person,,Shawn,https://uk.trustpilot.com/users/577aa1bd0000ff000a2ec8ac,Thing,Udemy,Organization,Trustpilot,https://uk.trustpilot.com,Rating,4

426,Review,2016-06-30T00:40:12+00:00,Can't afford college? Next best place to learn.,en,"My honest review of Udemy. 
Udemy is a great place to both learn new skills and investigate possible opportunities for new skills.
Not everything in Udemy you may want to learn or to learn in the process adopted. Sometimes the instructors can be a little tricky, but I have discovered several honest instructors that are interested in their students succeeding.
Be warned, the most popular courses aren't always the best ones. You need to take the instructor with a grain of salt. Sometimes the course might be a out of date, but you may still get your money's worth as the information might be hard to find elsewhere. Some instructors are tricky in that they offer a course, and when you buy, they then tell you that they have a new course with more up-to-date material on it. Some instructors are con-ish.
Do your research if you want to save money! Some courses are just abandoned. Some instructors teach information that you can just find on Youtube. Last of all, there are instructors that up date their course material frequently and don't have any gimmicks or traps for you.
Read the reviews and search deep for the good reviews, and in saying that, take most of the reviews with a grain of salt. If the reviews seem to be consistent about lack of updates or not very in-depth, then it's worth noting that many students have had similar experiences.
Udemy can be a good place to start a new career, maybe as an introduction, to something bigger and greater.
Give it a go, but don't put your head too high into the clouds, as you might be disappointed.
Always wait for the sales, they come fast and often.

Besides another e-learning service focussed more on coding, I have found Udemy to be an excellent resource to stay up to date and also learn new things whether they are business related or not.

To find the best courses out there, as with any product or service, I do recommend to investigate and compare the course you'd like to enroll in well to see what you'll learn and what other people's opinions are about the course. Read the description, watch the promo video as well as the free lessons if available and read the reviews to get a good impression. I've been on Udemy for several of years now and not once did I feel the need to ask for a refund.

Another thing I really like about Udemy is that you pay only once and get lifetime access to the purchased course which, for me, is a big plus with the overwhelming amount of subscription services these days.

454,Review,2016-04-20T19:43:50+00:00,"Great Content, Inept Service, Horrible Support",en,"If you proceed with Udemy, be aware there seems to be serious backend problems, and you might get bitten, as I have. If you DO have a problem, such as missing courses, be aware that -- incredibly, for a site that the champion of business excellence, Seth Godin, has endorsed (and has content on) -- Udemy's apparently skeletal customer support may not resolve the problem in a timely fashion, or even at all.

My story: Opened a Udemy account Jan 2015, purchased 7 courses up to March 2016. Got some great stuff and was about halfway through some of them, when, in March 2016, all my courses were removed from my account without warning or explanation. I also got a new welcome letter, in French (I'm not kidding).

Have patiently supplied the email receipts of the courses I bought and Udemy is not doing a thing to resolve it by restoring access or a refund/credit, even though they promise a ""lifetime guarantee"" to the courses. I bought these products, and they are not being supplied. I get emails that say this: 

""I’m sorry for this trouble! I will be forwarding your concern to the appropriate team to further research this issue for you. You should receive a message from them shortly.""

But there's been no contact from the ""appropriate team."" I don't want ""research,"" I want resolution. I don't have a ""concern"" I have a broken transaction! I want the products I purchased. How hard is it to restore access to the courses I purchased, or put a credit on my account so I can repurchase my courses and get back to work? This is precisely what I've asked for several times, and my request is ignored. A textbook example of how NOT to do Customer Support.

I've looked, but there is no phone number to call. There's no chat with support on the site. You have to fill out a form and wait for a reply. My replies have come at 6 pm my time, once a day. I would think, for the revenues this site must be generating, they afford some customer support.

This is more problematic than it may seem. I am wondering why this is bothering me so much, and I realize that it's more than just a ""product."" I'm seriously invested, and I'm seriously let down. 

Think about the personal investment a person makes to work through an online course. Think about a person trying to bootstrap their life, or their career. I set aside three days this month -- turned down paying work -- to work on these courses and improve my life. Not only are my courses gone, but so are all of my progress markers, online messages with instructors and classmates, updates, and any access to the downloads and instructors (it's all handled through the site). I have invested a large amount of time in these courses. For two of these courses, I've put in around 40 hours of time. I have thick notebooks filled with notes and printout from the courses -- half done. I cannot complete them and am cut off from the instructors and communities surrounding them. 

I feel as though I have been kicked out of school. 

OK then, now I am picking up the pieces, cheering myself on, and finding another way to move forward.",Person,,Paul Tumey,https://uk.trustpilot.com/users/5717d9d30000ff000a193639,Thing,Udemy,Organization,Trustpilot,https://uk.trustpilot.com,Rating,1

My concern is about the emphasis on low value courses that trainers are placing on the site, which they price at $100-$500 and then discount down to $9 or less. Many of these courses are purporting how to make money on Udemy.

These have the feel of a pyramid scheme. If you placed these courses early, you get all the benefit. It seems harder for new course providers to break in and the advice seems to be to secure a lot of free learners to show 'social proof' - further devaluing the platform. Udemy does seem to be in a bit of a downward spiral.

I think the platform needs to ask: is it a platform largely targeted at the Get-rich-quick and affiliate markets or will they shift to being a platform that markets high quality learning.

Will your employers look at the certificates? probably not. However they will look at the work you produce sometimes. I took a VBA course and got a couple jobs explaining some of the skills. Are all the courses flippin fantastic? No. There are a few here that are awful, but that's on par w/ everywhere else. You need to research before you buy. Check out the reviews. Check out what's already available free on teh interwebs and compare it to the subject matter in the course you are interested in. Then check out the untimed previews. THEN take a 5 minute preview and quickly go through a few topics you really want to know in a course. See if the instructor is just reading notes to put you to sleep (don't buy!!) or if they are Demonstrating skills (buy!). The majority demonstrate. But once you hit a few losers that just read bedtime material for insomniacs (reading slides, powerpoints, websites, reviewing software w/o actually demonstrating etc.), you wise up. Is udemy good? no, it's great! it raised my income. Are All the courses great? no, don't buy willy nilly, research what you buy first- just like everything else you buy.

With Udemy, I've found a wide range of courses: covering what I need to learn in order to update my skill sets, and, a number of special interests I just enjoy learning more about. There are basic FREE courses to get started with, and a range of paid courses to cover topics from a variety of angles. I found I was able to map out a pathway toward where I need to be with my marketable skill sets, updating established skills and building upon my hands-on work experience to keep competitive with newer workers in the field.

Lots of great course sales, too; but what is most exciting to me is that I have been able to taylor my learning experience to meet my own specific needs. There are a lot of great, passionate teachers on Udemy, too; and maybe there is the odd person just out to make a buck but where are you NOT going to find that happening!

There are plenty of free high quality courses done by instructors who have good experience in that subject. If you are looking at doing a specific job, then looking at the Udemy courses are a good way of seeing what is involved by instructors who do this everyday and learn some tricks of the trade as well.

I have taken subjects that I didn't know anything about and I now have a good understanding in those areas.I listen to the courses at work, ones that are basically audio with only a small amount of video used as I do my work. I have built up a library of courses (150) which I am going through the non technical ones first.

The selection of subjects is comprehensive, from art, business, programming languages, project management, science to astronomy.

The courses are normally for life access and some courses are being further developed from the feedback of students to benefit all students.

The programming courses tend to be more a hands on approach with doing a specific lecture and then experimenting yourself, so these courses take a lot more time to finish.

I finally found a course that did just that and various other courses have all been very impressive. I' am extremely grateful and know it is a answer to pray. God really lead me to this website and I give Him all glory and praise. I was praying for many years for courses I could take in business and there are so many wonderful things to learn on Udemy. I believe what makes it stand out most though is the coupons and how much of the time you can get any course for $10 to $19 dollars. I always felt I could pay full price but it was so good to know that I could get a good deal on these courses because I always planned to take more then just a few courses. 
So with so much to choose from it really is the best thing you can do, is sign up with Udemy. What amazes me about them is that they could easily charge people a fee every month for offering so many fantastic courses but they don't and its free! 
Also many courses are free so even if your on a tight budget you can always find courses to take with no charge. 
Personal thanks to Udemy for creating this website. It really has changed so many peoples lives, building bridges between instructors and students all in one convenient place, I don't see why I go anywhere else! Too many great deals going on here! 
I can tell you for certain you can trust Udemy and the instructors on here.

Tip to fellow learners.
1.  With the 10 dollar coupons it could be a better place for a learner than an instructor.  
2. Use common sense, some instructors are clearly trying to cash in with junk, if you see a flashy course with popular titles like ""Hacking ..."" For $149.00 But the course is only an hour or two long be suspicious.
3.  Any course under 2 hours should be free.  To learn anything is going to take more than 10 hours.  Many instructors offer great detailed courses 8, 10 or even more hours long with a $10 dollar coupon.

I have over a dozen courses in MY COURSES list. I notice you list the ""stats"" of a course PRIOR to purchasing (by Stats, I mean: total Lessons, Hours of videos, etc) but only list on the home page of each course, each tile-showing videos and Lessons.. what would REALLY help me as a student is to see in the MAIN page for THAT course.... HOW LONG IN TOTAL for that ENTIRE course... it will take me to complete each course. Right now the way it is, i have to manually add up the total hours needed to complete, by looking at the minutes for all the videos etc. In other words, I can prioritize and manage my time learning better if I knew how many hours in TOTAL of video, how many lectures, etc are needed in EACH course, on the HOME page of each course.

606,Review,2015-08-11T18:30:41.373+00:00,Udemy Feature Requests & Updates,en,"If you're looking to get some great training from some industry professionals, educators and those that are just passing on their talents then you must check out Udemy's offerings - I've enjoyed my recent classes and have gained some additional skills here and there.

With so many classes to choose from one can get lost pretty easily on determining what the most current course is under any given title. The main drawback, which leads to wasted time, is that there is no filter to sort by date ... and for that matter, a lack of ways to easily sort through the classes.

Now that I taken a few courses, I think Udemy, to improve their offerings and relevance to their users, should require instructors to list two important factors in their course description that aid in purchasing:
1) What version of software their class pertains to (or Udemy should remove out-dated courses from their offerings); and
2) If the instructor talks about user statistics, trends, percentage of marketplace, etc. that they must cite where these statistics/numbers came from ... many of the courses seem to contradict themselves and I am left wondering where these instructors got their information or are they just pulling numbers out of the air to suit their discussion? Let's remember when we went through primary school that we all had to cite sources of important information ... this is very much needed today since plagiarism and non-nonsensical information is passed on through internet.

The third issue that favors badly with using Udemy's website is in managing the courses one takes. There are a few filters, but for someone like me that has 150+ courses that I paid for there is no easy way for me to group classes together. I must scroll through my courses to find a particular one I'm looking for. So I recommend that Udemy implements a 'lightbox' feature like stock-photography websites do. This would allow a user to create folders titled: 'Software', 'Programming', 'Photography', etc. and then place similar courses into these folders ... much easier to find and view similar courses.

Despite my three criticisms, I would recommend Udemy to others.",Person,,Daniel MacLeod,https://uk.trustpilot.com/users/55ca3f510000ff0001d36c93,Thing,Udemy,Organization,Trustpilot,https://uk.trustpilot.com,Rating,4

Areas I feel need improvement are:
Course quality - Improving all the time but has a way to go. Important because Udemy allows everyday people with no teaching background to put courses up. This is great, but means review process should be more stringent.
Interaction with students - It should be easier to interact with students and offer exams, tests and quizzes much easier than it is. The discussion board is okay but could be improved by breaking it up into forum discussions allowing students to see all discussion easier. 
Sales process - Udemy has so many low end $10. sales going not that very few people now buy at full price or a decent price. Great, but cheapens the products. 
I am sure I would have more idea's for improvement but that is it for now.
