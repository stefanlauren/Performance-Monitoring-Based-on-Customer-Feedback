4,Review,2021-04-01T12:30:06+00:00,"High quality courses, terrible quality website",en,"Good quality videos and courses, however both the offline player and website have constant massive technical issues and bugs:

* Very expensive compared to similar sites, which would be justified if not for all of the bugs on Pluralsight's end.

* Online player buffers the clip completely, but then consistently and frequently stutters every few seconds. I have found no way to fix as supposedly with the clip fully buffered, it shouldn't occur.

* Very slow server responses, signing up and joining can be a 30 minute wait, after paying ~£25pcm I had to wait for almost 40minutes to be able to access any content.

* The offline player has even more bugs, such as corrupted audio for clips, not recognising you are a paid member or even logged on to access the content.

* The offline player also doesn't play clips at certain speeds, meaning you have to change the speed of the video to watch it, and then change it again for the next clip. This can be very frustrating when each clip is generally only a few minutes long

* I have tried to provide feedback on these issues multiple times, but never had any feedback or assistance for how to possibly remedy any of these, or even help on what I may be doing wrong.",Person,,Owen,https://uk.trustpilot.com/users/5e7dfc133d06219b96724cab,Thing,Pluralsight,Organization,Trustpilot,https://uk.trustpilot.com,Rating,2

I’m fully aware that there could be changes in the content, however take away those very popular and new courses is a major change in their offer and if you take away anything you need to give a warning in advance so people could finish what they are doing.

I had seen that they had a promotional sale in December 2020 which took about $150 off of their premium membership. 

I signed up for the trial period to make sure I wanted it, and 3 days into the trial they charged me FULL price. I immediately emailed them and asked why I was charged for a trial. I was told that I never signed up for a trial, which was an outright error or lie. The latter I am leaning towards now. Anyways, even if I did sign up for a membership, why was I not charged the promo price? I asked that during the emails and no one answered me.

I settled for a refund, then re-buying at the promo price. It has been a week and nothing on my credit account has changed. Im currently bugging them for a full refund because this is extremely sketchy.

On Sept 10th I received from my Account Manager an ""Early renewal - offer"". I contacted him within few days saying that I was not interested in renewing due to company financial situation. However, I was informed that I was too late. 
It turns out that, even though I received a ""Early renewal offer"" on Sept 10th, this was in fact the last day to submit a cancellation request for my company's subscription. No prior comms (calls or emails) were sent to me to inform me of the upcoming annual renewal.
Despite my numerous emails, my so called account manager did not send a single reply. 
I have instead started receiving emails from their Account Receivables department informing me that my renewal invoice was past due. 
I have tried to reason with them that, given the current market conditions, they should have informed me of the upcoming renewal, that I had in fact cancelled my subscription ahead of renewal date and that if they persisted with this they will not be paid any time soon.
I have asked to speak to someone in their management team, but instead I was threatened with our case being referred to a credit collection agency.
I think it is extremely underhanded to rely on the excuse of an autorenewal clause without the shadow of customer notice or any other comms. I understand everyone is fighting to survive, but this is not the way to do it.
I will not be paying this people and I will be happy to fight them in court.

After a second email pluralsight have agreed to make an exception to their policy and refund me my money.

BE AWARE. Pluralsight will trick you into taking your money. I signed up for a 'free trial' I got distracted by the real world (i know  unbelievable) 2 months later i found nearly £50 has been taken from my account.  This company operates a policy of we are going to stay as quiet as possible and take all the money we can from and only send you notifications after the fact, they then make it VERY DIFFICULT to get this resolved and so far i have not been able to get any money back.  I have never used anypart of the pluralsight service during the free trial or otherwise and they still think it is acceptable to take my money from me.  This type of behaviour from companys has to stop and should be a default opt in to continue the service or at the very least given an option to choose not to continue after the trial.

However, drawing and sketching are highly valuable skills, which are loosely covered here - even though the creative path is probably one of the best on the internet. 
I would also like to see more business and digital-marketing orientated classes here as well.

The other thing which really bothers me is the badly structured subscription plans they have - for example, for the practice-based classes you can have access to them only by a premium subscription - which is entirely based on a Y2Y basis, not month by month. 
This is a more than odd decision by their marketers, as the kind of people who will most probably benefit from this service are such that they still don't have the necessary skills and earnings to spend so much on a course which was supposed to be designed for amateurs. If there was a monthly based premium subscription I was most probably going to pay extra for it and it really annoys me.

TL;DR - great platform, really handy, but for me lacking enough coverage for creative and digital marketing paths, as well as the proper payment plans that suit your target audience the best.",Person,,Eugene Mihaylov,https://uk.trustpilot.com/users/5ee9e411fbf4634bcca5df2f,Thing,Pluralsight,Organization,Trustpilot,https://uk.trustpilot.com,Rating,3

Is that what Pluralsight needs to do? Is that because they can't make money through their courses? What does that say about their courses, then?

STAY AWAY from this company.

In August 2018 I signed up for the (((FREE))) 10 day trial, and after going through the disappointingly mediocre material on the site I decided to cancel the trial again.

After having SUCCESSFULLY cancelled my subscription and having my account downgraded to the free version again, I closed the site and moved on, thinking nothing of it.

But these SLIMY, HONORLESS people decided to charge me the FULL 300$ anyway. ALL WITHOUT ANY E-MAIL NOTIFICATION WHATSOEVER!

After contacting them about this issue, their arrogant and rude customer service just brushed it off like it was MY fault for them charging me money despite my cancellation. They just referred me to handle this with my local bank or vendor.

TL;DR Cancelled the free trial, was still charged the full price AND didn't even receive the subscription status on their website. Customer support didn't seem fazed and just brushed it off, taking the money for themselves like clockwork.

Yet from the looks of things on this site, while things are going sweet for him, something is going sour at Pluralsight. While the content of courses looks generally good, or even great, I recently had a billing issue which seemed shockingly shady. I signed up in December and then cancelled in February, only because I got busy with other things and couldn't make full use of the service. My CC got billed the following month. I went to their user portal to check my account status; my account was still ""active"" but my subscription status was dropped down to ""free"" which basically meant that I could log in to the site but couldn't watch any course videos. I assumed that maybe the billing period had reached its border earlier or later than I thought, but I was billed the next month again. I contacted customer service, and they ended up clearing the issue up, but I still think it should not have happened in the first place. Having worked in production at a SAAS start-up, and after reading all these reviews, it's hard for me to imagine this kind of ""error"" is not something of a deliberation coming from upper management or a higher-level sales & revenue initiative.

Most companies auto renewals go month to month after the first year.  We just got billed for a full new year with their auto-renewal with really no notice. This was a $ 4,000 hit to our credit card.  We reached out to Plural account representative only to have him say they could do nothing about it ""sorry"".  I read their terms and conditions and it does state that it does auto renew and there is no refunds. 

I have been in the IT service business for 30 years and I have never seen this kind of tactic.  Great way to loose a client.  There are some specific laws in CA that protect us from auto renewals which I will be using to get our money back. This Pluralsight policy is written to specifically screw people, so I would be careful working with this company before you sign with them.

Reversed charges with credit card,  sent email to sales representative and their legal department with no reply.  Pluralsight billed us again with no communication.

Unfortunately, this is overshadowed by their incredibly poor customer service.
Our company was on an annual subscription and received an invoice 15 days prior to our renewal. The invoice showed a significant increase over the previous year. We immediately tried to contact them to work out a solution. For the first contact, it took them over a week to get back to us. After several days of being unable to work out a compromise on price and/or reduction in licenses, we decided to cancel.
At that point, we were told we were not able to cancel since cancellation needed to be done 30 prior to the renewal.
We have pointed out time and time again that we tried to work with them immediately after being notified of the price increase (which was also given to us after the cancellation deadline had passed).

Coming from a customer service background I expected that I could work with them on this and potentially pay either a pro-rated portion of the outstanding amount and reduce the user count to 2, or come up with another fair solution that left us using their service but with a reduced user count.  Plural Sight was unwilling to budge from their stance of making me pay 2732 USD even though I only had 2 users log in for a total of  approximately 1 hour each.  The account rep Pierce is unprofessional and the only thing he ever says is ""I cannot help with that"".

I spent time planning my lessons and had audio trouble that the editor they set me up with was not able to help me resolve.  As a full time employee, I needed to work on this project when I had pockets of time.  Waiting for feedback was very slow and didn't work out with my schedule.  I asked to be able to work with a more responsive editor, but was denied. I moved to another state and brought all this equipment with me, as well as a different laptop (which would probably resolve the audio issues).  Soon after, I was told my project was cancelled.  I asked for the $200 reimbursement- not any $ for my time or moving expenses or anything else.  I was told by the editor that I would get it.  I corresponded with him monthly, reminding him of the money owed to me.  This went on for 5 months before I gave up.  I do not recommend working with or purchasing from a company with these poor business ethics.

Also- I have used Pluralsight for training myself and have found that a lot of the content is outdated and obsolete. It is difficult to find the software version on the courses.

The layout is clean with a record held of which courses you have completed and where you are in a course. This makes it very easy to dip in and out of your learning. The content tree provided sufficient information to be able to come back to a course and use it for reference if and when you need it.
A fantastic addition to the offering is the App (depending upon licence purchased) to allow courses to be downloaded for off line learning such as travelling / commuting.",Person,,Richard Kerr,https://uk.trustpilot.com/users/591411380000ff000a96e527,Thing,Pluralsight,Organization,Trustpilot,https://uk.trustpilot.com,Rating,4

So far I've done 60+ courses on javascript, unity game engine, C#, JQuery, ASP.net core, CompTIA+, CSS, HTML5, plus many other general programming courses just to see what they were about and get a handle on how they work. I've been like a kid in a sweet-shop, the sweets being IT courses!

It has enabled me to do a new website. Whereas before I used a website-making-software for the job, this time I was able to ""program"" the website using Brackets, CSS3, HTML5 and all ""coded"" by myself, but thanks to the great tutors on pluralsight.com.

Pluralsight has been extremely helpful and their lessons are very high quality. They even have one on one mentors, which is something not many other (I don't think any) competitors of pluralsight can offer.

Another really important point is the price, pluralsight offers very, very cheap prices if compared to for example udemy, which makes you pay per course. With one payment per month (probably a little more than the cost of one udemy course), you have access to the whole library of thousands of courses.

You can also test your skills, by taking quizzes and tests to determine your knowledge on a specific area, pluralsight tells you how much you have improved and which courses to look over. If you want to learn a specific subject area from start to end, there are paths that you can take that go through a range of courses that build up in skill /9beginner, intermediate and advanced)

Watched a few other videos and this was confirmed, there is a lot more muddled down tutorials with wannabe professionals that are teaching outdated techniques or not going in depth in the courses.

I like the model and I like the courses and learning paths. It helps us developers to keep up with the technology changes and the learning transforms to help us in our day-to-day jobs. I have only one complaint: Technology field changes quickly and we have to be up-to-date, but Pluralsight has accumulated many courses over the years and the old courses are there as is. As a  newbie to a course I cannot distinguish as a learner if the course is out-dated/legacy and what is the latest alternative course ? Same goes for learning paths. I would prefer them to not update the old courses, but tag them instead and point to new alternatives.That gives options to learners if they want to proceed with legacy course.

It needs to be more hands on that simulates job training since most employers expect you to have concrete experience for any job.  It needs to be more of projects of smaller scale that developers will likely perform on their jobs.  Employers basically don't train their employees, but expect them to have array of skills and be ready to go from first day without much supervision at all.  Even if authors have to break it down to part 1-4, since they are the foremost experts in the field, they ought to know what goes on in the job and what duties that needs to be fulfilled.  I consider pluralsight a legitimate job training sites and with proper training, learners will be able to create projects that mimic real world scenarios.  For example, C# and Java courses need to include more real world projects in smaller scale to simulate actual experience.  Now you have Simon Allardice - the expert in Javascript, IOS and Swift...

596,Review,2016-01-19T19:30:35.75+00:00,New courses are not well prepared!,en,"Hello,

During the past years, I watched many courses online, the old Trainsignal courses are quite nice, generally speaking, but new ones are not as good as old Trainsignal videos, of course, with some exceptions.

In some of them, the instructors just list a few lines and then read some abstract, out-of-context subject matter without caring about the audiences.  The general abstract talks are not really tutorials, they just tried to market the new powerful features the products offer, such as Exchange 2010 and 2013 courses.  They are awful! 

Others are wonderful, such as Implementing Cisco UCS: Installing and Configuring by by Jason Nash is excellent one.

As a loyal customer, I sincerely hope PluralSight can improve the quality control in a big way to raise our reputation in the industry.",Person,,Sincere customer for a long time!!!!,https://uk.trustpilot.com/users/569e8ebd0000ff0001fde344,Thing,Pluralsight,Organization,Trustpilot,https://uk.trustpilot.com,Rating,3

We get to know their thought process and also useful pointers to other valuable resources from them.
The authored contents are awesome and explained in a nice way. The best thing about it is that we can always repeat the module when it's hard to digest in first attempts. This is not there in offline classroom training sessions. Through Pluralsight, I am getting access to courses by international authors. This too, at my own time and pace and sitting at my home. Sometimes, I regret - why I got introduced to Pluralsight so late in my career. I should have hooked up to Pluralsight more than 5-6 years ago. My best wishes to Pluralsight.

653,Review,2015-10-07T13:35:41.328+00:00,3.5 Good but not Great,en,"If I just watch the videos the lessons do not stick in my mind.  However it does take the time specified.  

The easiest way to pass your tests is to take notes during the video and then answer the quiz from the notes.  However several of the answers are now wrong in  the latest version of the software.

Giving the correct answers from the latest software loses me points.  So doing the examples during the video is often pointless as it just confuses the course with versioning issues.

Even if the course is with the latest version and I am doing a 5 hour course and it takes me 15 hours to complete there are often details from the beginning of the course I have forgotten by the end of it.
So I need to take notes and do it in two stages.

When I try to do the exercises I waste hours and on occassion over a day to get them working with the latest software VS 2015 and EF 6  and SQL Express 2014 and occasionally I cannot do them at all as there are just too many differences.  

This often doubles or triples the length of the course.  However once completed the excercise from my notes and my knowledge of the latest version I do get a useful grounding in the lesson.

Occasionally, I get stuck in the exercises and because of the differences in environment I cannot spot where my mistake is and I do not want to waste your time with issues that are often stupid typos.

e.g. I am too used to XML rather than http and you should see the bizarre effects you can get:
if instead of writing < i glyphicon glypohicon-world > < / i > you write  < i  glyphicon glypohicon-world / > In my instance I only got 5 distinct instances of the icon instead of the expected 1.

However, comparing the after code with my code did spot that particular issue.  Sometimes they do not.  So overall a useful way of learning new skills but not perfect.

Please keep improving your courses.",Person,,Robin,https://uk.trustpilot.com/users/56151fad0000ff0001e1455a,Thing,Pluralsight,Organization,Trustpilot,https://uk.trustpilot.com,Rating,3

665,Review,2015-10-06T12:04:19.894+00:00,"Good mix of courses, let down by missing basic features.",en,"First the good news:
There are A LOT OF GOOD QUALITY COURSES on Pluralsight.com, mostly for technical training.  Some of their course leaders are experts in their field, and adept at making dry topics interesting enough for you to remain interested for (sometimes) 10-12 hours of course content.  

I have found some great courses on .NET, which have helped refresh my technical knowledge, and making development interesting again.  

There are some good 'business professional' courses too, e.g. the PMP Project Management courses, which allow you to count the hours spent on Pluralsight.com towards your certification.  That is a great help.

Downsides:
Some of the tutors are not good, and make no attempt to engage the audience.  Some just read exactly what it says on the slides.  This is pointless.  These courses need to be removed or re-done, as it appears some professionals just use Pluralsight as a way to self-publicise.  

I have not found a way to look at my course history, beyond the 10 'most recent' courses.  This is useless.  I can do 10 courses in a few weeks, but I cannot see beyond that.

Some of the technical courses are useless if you are not on the Plus subscription.  To me, this is like a bait-and-switch.  You'll see technical courses where the leader will say ""I'm not going to cover all the code here, you can see what I've done in the exercise files"" - but you cannot get the exercise files unless you are a Plus subscriber.  All the poor Normal subscribers are out of luck...  You might not realise you're missing fundamental information until you've spent hours on a course.  Then you cannot complete it.  This needs addressed.

The 'assessments' are like an afterthought on some courses, hardly worth bothering about.  

There doesn't seem to be a way to 'report' a course which is particularly bad.  You can rate it, and comment on the discussions, but that's about it.  You can tell how proud of their course the tutor is by their interaction with subscribers - some are great, providing extra info, going the extra mile.  Some don't bother to respond at all.

All in, it's the best of the bunch for CBT at your own pace.  

Oh, their iPad app is terrible - don't expect to use it for anything, you'll go mad.  And you cannot download more than 30hrs of content for offline viewing.  Which is unfortunate.  They should really have designed their infrastructure a bit better before growing so large.",Person,,Gordon,https://uk.trustpilot.com/users/5613b8c30000ff0001e0f7ff,Thing,Pluralsight,Organization,Trustpilot,https://uk.trustpilot.com,Rating,3

711,Review,2015-10-05T23:58:30.499+00:00,Review of PluralSight,en,"It is hard to navigate to my most recent courses using the mobile application. Oftentimes, the titles are truncated in the mobile application instead of being word-wrapped so that I can clearly see which course is Part I versus Part II, etc. The mobile application crashes a lot, inducing me to use the Web application. 

When you use people for whom English is a second language, their accents are often too great a barrier to learning the material. Consequently, I give up on such coarses and move onward. 

You have a lot of good material, but I wish it were presented in the way that Microsoft Virtual Academy presents many, although not all, of their learning seminars - showing two people interacting, discussing the good, bad, or indifferent about theo technology and moving slowly enough to duplicate their code instructions on my computer. I tried taking a C# course, but the instructor moved so fast that during demonstrations I found it hard to duplicate his efforts without rewinding. 

The rewind and fast-forward features need to become more prominent in the interface and allow granular control so that I can move back three seconds exactly, instead of moving the control backward and randomly being stuck having to view the last twenty seconds all over again because the control does not provide granular manipulation. 

The transcripts are abominable. It does not even look like someone tried to get the trascriptions right. Words run together and are misspelled, making it difficult to use that tool to supplement the video. 

I used to be able to download all of the lectures to my iPad for off-WiFi viewing. I looked for that option recently, but could not find it, please bring it back.

When I use PluralSight with my iPad and AppleTv, I have to click play at the beginning of every lecture in a module. I would like to be able to sit on my couch and have the lectures continuously stream until I want to stop, such that I would take some action to stop continuous playback. 

Content: The reason I purchased PluralSight was because I wanted advanced SQL Server 2014 or 2016 material. Although beginning material is helpful sometimes, I primarily watch for an explanation of the concepts associated with an advanced topic.

- To be really impressive, Pluralsight could offer a foot pedal to control stop/play, fast forward, and reverse. The videos have no value unless I type in the code myself and play with it.

Unfortunately, about 4/5 of it is hampered by being presented by the experts - and they are generally really boring and dull.  It's a real challenge to stay interested in a topic when the presenter drones on, repeats slides, and appears to be speaking slowly to try to extend the time of the course.

Look at ""Scaling SQL Server 2012"" with Glenn Barry.  He repeats the same slides/list of common application architecture faults AT LEAST 6 times before the actual section where he covers them.  You could skip the entire first two modules, and not miss anything.  And you have to speed up his audio to at least 1.3x normal, lest you be put to sleep.

Don't even bother with the Python courses with Robert Smallshire - very dull.  The whole 'Zen of Python' nonsense he perpetuates just puts off any normal developer as it is so pathetic and infantile. 

Top marks however to Miguel Castro, on his Building End-To-End Application course(s).  He keeps the audience engaged, keeps his examples realistic and does not pretend to have all the answers.  He just gives you the benefit of his experience.

As for the cost of the subscription - I would suggest that it is a bit sharp.  I pay $30 per month (2015 prices), with no source code nor slides, and it is a bit of a rip.  Plenty of the courses skip through source, and you cannot code along with them, since you never see the full source they are using.  This to me is bordering on bait and switch.  You have to pay a great deal more to get the full content.

The iPad app is a big fail, because of the buffering. It takes forever to buffer one section of a course, and given that all the courses are divided into many 2-8 minute chunks, most of the time is spent waiting for it to buffer. I don't have this problem on other video streaming apps... so it's clearly an app problem.

Particularly like Scott Allen's stuff but most authors are great and know their stuff.  

I have four main problems, so here they are: 
1) On the website itself: when loading video in the browser, sometimes the video does not load correctly and stops in the middle and you have to close the browser and reload.  
2) On the website: when you actually load up the course details and see the course overview with the chapters and episodes, it would be very nice if, when you have already watched some episodes of a chapter, to have the most recently watched chapter episode list automatically open out and the browser scroll down to the next unwatched episode - sounds kind of minor but it's actually pretty annoying after a while.
3) The android app: it is unfortunately unusable, mostly because of the choppy audio which renders most videos unlistenable to.  I will take another opportunity here to plead with Pluralsight to fix this.  As I have mentioned on my review on the Google Play Store, it's a real blemish on Pluralsight's record - cmon guys, it's not like you dont know any tech guys who can help you out with this.  
4) Chromecast: Chromecast is supported on the iPhone (I think), please can this be done for android devices as i love the chromecast and find it really useful.

Apologies if any of the above complaints have been fixed, i havent looked at the android stuff in a few months.

That's it.  I have until this december until my renewal - if the android app is fixed i will probably just renew without thinking, if not, I will be looking at alternatives.

I have now completed 145 courses and have upgraded my subscription to start taking the assessments and at this point I have nearly passed 50% of the courses I have undertaken.

My only real gripes are small and include the following:
1. Bookmark limitation, this is currently 100 but I have reached this limit and you can only have one playlist whereas like others I believe it would be good to allow multiple. I could then have categories such as AngularJS playlist, one for Node and one for practices and mythologies for example.
2. Streaming on the iPad application to a TV, apart from getting an Apple TV unlike Youtube I cannot stream to the TV from what I can see.
3. More advanced courses, I use Pluralsight, along with a lot of the blogs of the authors and other sources for presentations such as Channel 9 and Vimeo for conferences. However I feel some subjects would be great to have more advanced courses, I feel some of the courses Miguel A. Castro's courses are a great example of this, and he goes into depth and then recently has completed courses on WCF they really dive deep into that technology stack.

I have noticed that 'most' of the instructors are Windows based so things can get a little confusing sometimes. If you are coding along with the instructor, it appears that they do the video and then debug the code. So, you get bugs. No biggie for an instructor. For the rest of us - this can be a really big deal because there are TONS of moving parts and it is difficult to figure out which part is broken.",Person,,Mark,https://uk.trustpilot.com/users/551db2c90000ff0001b5d0ab,Thing,Pluralsight,Organization,Trustpilot,https://uk.trustpilot.com,Rating,4

Some courses ask you only 6 questions which is far by ideal because just 2 wrong answer and you fall below the 70% mark required to pass the assessment with lots of frustration, a 10 to 15 questions is more appropriate and also gives the chance to verify much better your understanding of the subject with less frustration. I also use the assessment system as a way to show to potential employers that I'm taking my training seriously and it doesn't really help when your public profile shows the text ""Assessment not passed"" under a subject you haven't even tried the assessment yet, just because you have finished to watch a course! Simply writing the text ""Assessment not attempted yet"" gives a completely different message to the viewer and is not rocket science to implement...",Person,,Edoardo,https://uk.trustpilot.com/users/551db2590000ff0001b5d092,Thing,Pluralsight,Organization,Trustpilot,https://uk.trustpilot.com,Rating,3
