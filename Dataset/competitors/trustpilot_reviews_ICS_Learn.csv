I started the CIPD L&D unfortunately with ICS. For couple months ago there's no adviser, no materials to review, literally empty website! It's just book titles that you need to order online!

Also all advisers are on vacation and never show up, never help you, & never ask you about your progress !

It's literally an empty website with no thing to study! all students are doing copy & Paste for the old students exercises & assessments!

I have opened case (Case # 138072) to refund my money and they reject my request because they know I can't go to UK to sue them but I will.

I'll keep posting this in LinkedIn to make people aware of this scammer empty platform!

82,Review,2021-05-31T11:04:00+00:00,I enrolled for the CIPD Level 5 course…,en,"So everyone can see the response from ICS to me below about how my concerns are being dealt with.  Just to clarify my concerns were first raised in February, the errors in the learning programme and presenting materials are still there. My last email was received on the 24th May 2021 at 21:29. I responded to that e mail both to tutors and student services. Still no response back, still no consideration for their students and clearly the response below shows that the customer service is simply token.

My advice if you are thinking of an online course ? Find a reputable company who understand the importance of teaching and learning. Don`t use ICS. 


I enrolled for the CIPD Level 5 course in February 2021. The sign up was fairly straightforward.
Considering that this is a Human resources qualification, there seems to be very little consideration given to learning needs.  The quality of course content is poor with several spelling and grammatical errors which disrupt the learning process. The Webinars are also of a very poor quality and focused on how to put together an assignment rather than teaching the subject itself.  Upon complaining about this (providing slide details and directing to the page) I received a reply stating that I had not provided enough information for them to look into.  I then found that on the APPLY section which is a self check question and answer on the subject that answers stated as correct were actually wrong, THIS WAS LATER CONFIRMED BY ICS.
Four months on the feedback received has been that they will review and fix the errors but wont say when they expect to do this by. As a student I am being asked to study materials which the provider has confirmed are wrong and wont let me know when they will be right.
Put this into basic terms, go to Costa pay for a coffee and then stand there and see how long you are prepared to wait as the barista gives you a cup and tells you they will get round to putting some coffee in it when they can be bothered to.
The course is 18 months, they offered no real apology or solution but did say I could have an extra two months to finish the course, which considering I had planned to complete in 12months is obviously irrelevant.
I am sure having looked at other ICS responses that there will be a comment of we cant find your details.  If anyone want I am happy to post comments from the student forums with the same feedback regarding course content and access.
This is a course costing 2.5k. If I presented similar materials at work I`d be quite rightly being performance managed under capability.",Person,,William Taylor-Doyle,https://uk.trustpilot.com/users/60b4c28abab042001a14dc86,Thing,ICS Learn,Organization,Trustpilot,https://uk.trustpilot.com,Rating,1

I passed both course units yesterday after around 70 hours of study.  It’s the first online qualification I have received.  I found their videos didn’t add to the other resources available,  I didn’t watch many, likewise the live sessions.  Some of the learning material seemed a bit clunky but they said they are aware and working on improving it.  The tutor I was assigned was very supportive and consistently prompt to respond via both the course communication portal and email.  I sometimes found responses needed some work before I gleaned the clarification I wanted.  It’s just not as easy as having a real live teacher with you.  But I didn’t need to resort to a phone call which was on offer.  And since I passed after putting in less than the recommended hours of work the course must be pretty good.  

I took on the bookkeeping in the small business I work for a month into this course using SAGE.

The course setup process was quick and efficient and i got tremendous support from the tutors in the first two units of the old course and i was able to complete and pass both the units comfortably however CIPD has introduced new courses from March 2021 but we did not get any update on when the new courses will be updated on their system until May. Even till now they have not updated the one specialist and optional unit and i have no choice but to wait without any information on when these courses will become accessible.

Also their has been a tremendous decline in the quality of their Q&A sessions since the new courses have been released which was never a problem before. Basically the tutor just reads the power point word by word and does not even make the slightest effort to explain the questions and what is actually been asked of us. I raised this issue with them and they told me that someone from their management will get back to me within 10 working days. It has been now more then a month and no one has bothered to contact me.

We were told that the feedback to our draft assessment will be provided in five working days and for the first two subjects i was able to get a response in five days however i have submitted a draft assessment for one of the new units eight days ago and have not still not received any response on it. They do not make the effort to communicate with the students and do not care about their experience. I do think most of the positive reviews here are on their sign up experience as they ask us to rate them when they send us the sign up email which in my personal opinion is misleading and a very wrong practice.",Person,,Vikram Arya,https://uk.trustpilot.com/users/601ea2e5e0ea780019723abc,Thing,ICS Learn,Organization,Trustpilot,https://uk.trustpilot.com,Rating,1

1. when I started the course we didn't have a support tutor, where I was getting feedback from my main tutor within the time frame since you introduced the support tutor it became very frustrated to get an answer back within the time frame, then having to send off our assessment which would take 10days or even more which in my case on or two Units it was 14days, also the tutor that was assigned to me in Unit 4 would never answer any of my question through pebble pad which again a platform was not friendly users, if I had not set up a WhatsApp group with some students I don't think I would have got any help from Tutor Support/Tutors, also with the online classes we found that even though its suppose to be an hour-long we found that in fact it was a lot shorter the last one I attended last 25mins, we were like WOW that's that the quickest one ever, I never attended any more online classes and went by the slides,  I  came across two Tutors who went out of the way and beone to help and they came back within 3 working days with our assessment, and even answer back on pebble pad, i couldn't thank them enough, which i did personally,  The student forum i more of a complaint then a help others, which i think should be looked at, I can honselty say without support from my family/friends/work colleague i would have not carried on with ICS.",Person,,Tracey Dunn,https://uk.trustpilot.com/users/59f5c1cd0000ff000adb629d,Thing,ICS Learn,Organization,Trustpilot,https://uk.trustpilot.com,Rating,3

I would rate 4.5 if it were possible, the only reason I wouldn't give a full 5 is because occasionally the course materials had typos in them or seemed a few years out of date - this wasn't much of a problem but worth mentioning.

I thought the webinars were really useful and the amount of content provided for each module was great! One thing i found difficult was a lot of the webinars were scheduled during the day and sometimes none for the evening which was quite hard where i work full time so i could only ever watch the recordings. I also think it was better having a different tutor per module rather than one tutor for everything.

I really liked that the tutors who marked my essay were on hand to answer my questions ahead of me submitting each assignment. However, since approx.. September 2020 when the tutor structure changed I personally found the tutor support was very different. The tutor support changed and the tutors were not marking our assignment. Following some brief exchanges with this new tutor support structure I didn't find them particularly helpful in answering my questions. 

My constructive feedback would be to re-visit the new tutor support structure as the old structure pre-September 2020 was fantastic.",Person,,Priti ,https://uk.trustpilot.com/users/5e3e89d648e5570078e85dc3,Thing,ICS Learn,Organization,Trustpilot,https://uk.trustpilot.com,Rating,4

As preparation for the assessments in webinars you are told one thing and as feedback from Tutors you are being told something else. 
One example of this is my last assessment. I asked for advise on my CPD and PDP and was told which items I could mention based on what I had done over the past 12 months by the support tutor.
The tutor of the assessment then failed me as it was not what she wanted to hear. This has been so frustrating throughout this process. You invest time in writing these assessments and then you have to invest even more time because different tutors have different opinions on what should be included.
On the other side, some tutors have been very helpful throughout the process and their guidance was very clear.

I learned everything from the basics to the more complicated bits. I liked that lessons were recorded so I could pause whenever I wanted and also learn whenever I could. I was in contact with three different tutors and they were all great teachers. They were always willing to help and replied very quickly to my questions. I would like to say a big thank you to Ailie, my tutor. She was extremely helpful and I was lucky to be one of her students. I had a lot of questions before the exam and she always took her time to explain things in detail and usually replied the same day. Also thank you to Kirsten, who was my tutor for a short period of time. Melissa is the in house maths teacher and she is usually the one who teaches the lessons. I found she was very good at explaining. I had no problem following her lessons, although I may suggest that sometimes she could have spoken a bit clearer. I got my desired mark.

The length of time for feedback from assessors was inconsistent regularly going over SLAs and blaming this on the pandemic.

274,Review,2021-04-13T17:54:19+00:00,*WARNING*,en,"*WARNING* 
I just wanted to say that the experience of using online learning was different to what I had expected. I was hoping to study while working giving me the advantage of having my work to support me with my study as I wanted to get a qualification in HR.

However, for those who do not understand how this works it can be very frustrating and banging your head against a wall. 

Here are the negative points that no one tells you:
1. You only have 1 tutor you can call and even then it has to fit around the time she has so it's not that convenient. 

2. The tutor's way of teaching does not go into the depth of explaining concepts, so they won't give you a definitive answer, they will say things like ""you might need to read that again"" and when challenging them to explain in a way I can understand, I had on numerous occasions got the answer ""your nearly there but its missing information"" which leads me to the next point

3. You only allowed 2 submissions and after that, you can fail the module. But they won't fail you, they just keep getting you to rewrite the same things without any guidance.

4. Because of the previous point, I could not move forward as I wasn't able to start other modules until I finished the first one, in some ways I see this as a very clever scam. 

5. I went to the Facebook forum page and you can see lots of people struggling, but they will never admit they have given up, and I'm considering asking for freedom of information to ask how many have done these ""courses"" and how many people have actually passed in comparison to how many have done the ""course"".....

6. If you read the reply from ICS about the stats on how 99% of people have passed: 1. This was not the information I had asked for and it is something I can request personally. 2. If it's 99% pass rate it does not explain why your trust pilot is not 4.9 or a 5?

7. My advice is to go to college and as for a Student loan (just google it) This can be paid back over time until you earn over a certain amount which is very helpful especially for those who cannot afford it, it also helps to check if you are able to get free support depending on your age if you go back to FT education, which is what I have done through the lockdown. Social learning is way much better and you have real help and you can discuss and share ideas and experiences with others.

This was a very isolating experience, even with the help of my manager at work could not understand why they kept on failing me.

Also, people write these reviews when they have just started, and very rarely do they get a chance to give a clear overall experience opinion.

HR Diploma L3  - you can earn this through Gov apprenticeships and you get paid. 

I am still paying off this course after I ran out of time and if you want extra time you have to pay for more time to ICS.

If ICS apologise it's only because the person is employed to apologise. They are not sorry, it is a business. If they are sorry they are actually admitting to blame. I have spoken to numerous people especially Paul Martin who has probably had the same problem as his responses sounded automated and clinical on the phone. 

I hope this review helps someone because all of the 5 star reviews are not representing the true image of ICS as it is right now.

The only thing I would say is some of the course material did have spelling mistakes and was hard to read at times. 

I found the support tutor Natalie very helpful with all assignments that I needed clarifying. Mark, Keith and Leigh were very helpful and clear in their feedback and gave me tips on how to improve in the future which I really appreciated. All three of them were so nice and approachable over the platform even though I have never met them.

Mark was so hopeful he is an amazing tutor. We had a call and spoke about my career going forward and how I will get the course finished which really motivated me and I felt like he cared about his students which is very rare especially online. 

Sometimes I would say the assignments take along time to mark with some tutors maybe because of there high workload I’m not sure. 

Keith was very quick at marking which I loved I got most of my assignments back the same day I submitted them which was great as I could move onto the next subject. 

Overall I loved the course, tutors and the course material and have recommended it to several people since.

Thank you

Be it their formative and summative assessments, tutor support, timely responses by the student support, price- match guarantee, flexibility of payments, ease of one’s coursework, and student-centricity, the overall ecosystem of ICS Learn stands out. 

ICS Learn keeps raising the bar when it comes to providing a gratifying learner experience, and with the onset of the pandemic it has proved this by being sensitive to one’s personal  and professional challenges. 

Frankly speaking, I started my CIPD journey with them as just another name on the block. Fast forward an association of 2+ years, completion of 11 modules across level 5 and level 7, I can easily say that having studied with a leader, I couldn’t have asked for more !

At the time I could not have recommended ICS highly enough! the tutors were very knowledgeable, available to discuss issues quickly and demonstrated support for my learning. 

In 2019 I decided to further my studies and I am currently studying my Level 7 CIPD with ICS. Sadly the experience I had a few years ago was much better and retrospectively I would have chosen a different provider. 

The tutors now show minimal support or care for my learning. The recorded lessons are not always delivered by your tutor and as such, can conflict with the your tutors advice or at times are simply unclear. Receiving a grade for coursework has also increased from 5 days to two weeks. 

I suspect that ICS has seen an increase in students over the last year and, whilst I believe that they have recruited new tutors to accommodate  the increase in work, the support and service that was once offered has suffered considerably. 

Overall my experience has been ""fine"" and I have recently referred friends and family to them with the above caution, suggesting that they explore all options carefully.",Person,,Hannah  Maxwell,https://uk.trustpilot.com/users/5dffb10298483676f9765dee,Thing,ICS Learn,Organization,Trustpilot,https://uk.trustpilot.com,Rating,3

I started my GCSE Maths and English course with them 2 years ago and was suppose to take the exams last year. Due to the pandemic, my exams were cancelled then and again this year. 
The whole reason I chose to study with them was because I have three children and I needed something where I can study in my own time. 
After the announcement was made for the cancellation of all exams for the 2nd year, we were sent emails to advise us to pay and take a set of mock exams to aid with the predicted gradings. We were suppose to sign up for these within a few days of receiving the email with no proper guidelines to who would be eligible for predicted gradings. 
After having to think it through quickly, I decided to forfeit my English GCSE exams and concentrate on my Maths exams only due to the lost time of studying with all the homeschooling I have had to do. 
Roughly a month later, I receive the email to tell me the criteria for the predicted grading and I didn't make it for one of them. 
By this point, the mock exam was due to be taken in 11 days and when I emailed the teacher explaining my situation, that I really needed to pass at least one of these exams to get onto my next course this September (having already lost out on a year), the email I got back was short and basically told me to wait till November to do the exams then. 
To say I was let down is an understatement. I was practically in tears and couldn't think of what else to do. I called up the college I wanted to do the course with the next day and the advisor told me to take the Functional Skills Level 2 course for both English and Maths which could be done in 13 weeks time ( as long as the university I'm applying for will accept them), this means I will have plenty of time to do these before September. 
The relief I felt was immense. I felt like if ICS cared for their students welfare then they could've giving me this advise as well but they never gave me anything. 
I have now been on the phone to them at least 4 or 5 times regarding the refund of my mock exams that they couldn't let me tske but accepted the money for before even knowing the criteria and all I keep getting is they will get back to me ( it has now been 14days).",Person,,sammi Luu,https://uk.trustpilot.com/users/6058adc6f4387f001b455640,Thing,ICS Learn,Organization,Trustpilot,https://uk.trustpilot.com,Rating,1

Sometimes you really had to scrabble around for answers which should have been easy.   More information and guidance on word counts is needed, including what should and shouldn't go in the appendices', all practical stuff with little to no guidance meant weeks of delays for me in trying to get it right and waiting from responses from tutors.     I think you pay a lot of money for the course and in all fairness when I did get to speak to a tutor it wasn't helpful and I felt like I was being a nuisance.    There was one tutor who did truly help me, Caroline was great and stepped in to help me when I getting no help from other tutors but by this point I felt I was in crisis, ready to give up as it wasn't worth the impact on my health. 

 Maybe distance learning isn't for everyone but at Level 7 I would have expected more tutor support and guidance.  The ability to speak to someone monthly for 20 minutes would have been really beneficial and make the experience I had much less painful. I wouldn't recommend distance learning to anyone who actually need to have a discussion to learn.  Huge amounts of reading and I feel like I primarily taught myself.

Achieved a Grade 9 in my Double Science IGCSE this year having taken the ICS course. Angeline the tutor was always willing to help with any questions I had.

My advice to anybody wanted to go back and study their GCSEs for whatever reason - it's very doable, just takes commitment and organisation with your study time and plenty of revision.

The rest of the tutors were fabulous and I have no complaints what so ever about them. The responded within the promised time with support and helpful insights.

This being said, I was able to pass my qualification and I believe at the time ICS were more cost effective than other providers. 

1) Delay in marking - they advertise a 5 working day in SLA but in one instance went over double this. When I escalated to student support they were not able to advise and only closed my case once the assignment had been marked. 

2) Lack of clarity in feedback. Some (not all) tutors would not provide the clearest guidance in online sessions or in marking. At times I felt quite isolated and relied on external advice such as Facebook groups for support to help me pass this qualification, even after joining all available classes and rewatching online classes. 

If you are not self motivated and feel as though you might need extra support, you may find it beneficial to investigate providers who offer more support as well as structured timelines to complete your assessment.",Person,,Elloise Clayton,https://uk.trustpilot.com/users/605346ffd7336c001a7f2ea4,Thing,ICS Learn,Organization,Trustpilot,https://uk.trustpilot.com,Rating,3

483,Review,2021-03-11T17:06:01+00:00,Will suit some but needs modernising - AAT combined,en,"Similar to others, combined AAT course. Majority 5 stars have left a review not long after signing up, 1 star reviews come from longer users. I found it below standards of other online courses I've completed (first course i've cancelled too). 

Pros: Study in own time, study guide, tests (temperamental whether they mark answers correctly or not). 
Cons: Lessons are a tutor dictating powerpoint slides with audio full of static background noise. Learning materials have so many contextual & grammatical errors (missing words etc). 

Be aware you are paying for the course and need to sign up/pay for exams & AAT yourself. Can't book exams until registered with AAT, I'd have done this straight away if not for one of the tutors emailing stating they would register the qualification with AAT ""within 3 weeks"" and to expect a following email of how to sign up... It never came. So I waited to book exams due to their info and when mentioned there was never a sense of an apology. 

Ended up using other resources, cancelled after 3 months and paid the fee, they then emailed welcoming me to the next level of study?? Safe to say their communication and transparency isn't great.

484,Review,2021-03-11T12:35:44+00:00,Unsatisfactory course,en,"This course is a self study course. When I signed up to do GCSE psychology , it all seemed very straight forward. I paid for the course in full with the understanding that I have to organise going to an exam centre.
The reason I have given this course 1star is because of a few issues. 
1- there are issues with the spelling throughout the course. It really needs proof reading. I'm dyslexic and I noticed the issues! This made it a little harder for me to study.  
2- this course offers a tutor. The course also say if I have any questions contact your tutor. Unfortunately the tutor is NOT helpful in any way.  
A few times I asked questions on certain words and how the word would be used in context. The response I received was copied and pasted from the section I was reading. I said I need another example that's why I contacted the you(the tutor). The response I received was ""this is a self study course"" . Not helpful at all.
• Another issue with the tutor was , when , I asked for something to be cleared up. In the ics course there was a section that did not match the GCSE book that I had , I had ask the tutor about this and I gave her the information but it was never solved.

Basically the tutor is not worth contacting because they do not help in anyway. Why on earth they are called a tutor baffles me as they do not tutor. They only check the test papers you send them. They should be given a different name like 'exam observer or exam advisor' not tutor.

The only help I had was when I submit my test papers.

My best advice is not to sign up to this course . I have a GCSE book that has exactly the same information and is just as helpful and without any spelling errors. I wish I had saved my money and bought a few books, the course in my mind is a waste of money .

*Unfortunately the reply from ics is not good enough. They said ' It's good to know that you've been able to make use of the unlimited Tutorial support for the course and that your Tutor has appropriately responded to all your queries'

I asked the tutor questions when I needed help but she doesn't help in anyway! This in my mind isn't making use of the unlimited Tutorial support because I had NO SUPPORT and stopped asking questions !!
They need to change the title to the tutor' they do support the student. They only mark the very few questions on the test paper at the end of each unit.

This reply from ics is also unsatisfactory.",Person,,Annita Smith,https://uk.trustpilot.com/users/5e415e2dbef4a4fa446bc9ce,Thing,ICS Learn,Organization,Trustpilot,https://uk.trustpilot.com,Rating,1

It's currently a pandemic - And, in my experience, a lot of companies have really struggled (As to be expected). But despite this, and the hectic and volatile nature of academia. 

ICS has persistently kept me informed and hit the mark. My tutor is very consistent at responding to queries and is always able to deliver extra resources if the ICS Learning content isn't enough.

There are thorough tests throughout the courses to keep you conscious of the content you are learning. And they even have mini-mocks at the end of each unit. 

I can't be certain of my grade, but I've been studying the Double Award science for about 5 months. And in that time, I've managed to cover all the content and move onto practice papers. I'm confident in ICS Service. I should note they also transferred my course as soon as they could, when it was discovered I needed to complete more than one GCSE in science. 

They also (if I'm not mistaken) use Moodle (or something very similar to it), which for those who don't know is a platform that I can remember ever since Primary school. It's pretty easy to use, and has been developed for so long it means that the ICS Site is easy to navigate and is very user friendly. (It's also optimised for mobile devices, and even one of my old laptops has no problem displaying the pages) 

They also have resources for students, to find exam centres near them and other information. also a student community and a team who you can contact with any other questions you have.

Overall a brilliant service, I can't fault them.",Person,,Cameron Bishop,https://uk.trustpilot.com/users/5efb6528e3700148fa549e5f,Thing,ICS Learn,Organization,Trustpilot,https://uk.trustpilot.com,Rating,5

It was easy to contact your advisor, who replied really quickly. As I needed a IGCSE science grade C (I chose biology).

I told my ICS Learner advisor that I wanted to take the exam in November 2020 or January 2021, he did advise me to take the exam in the summer months of 2021!! I said I’d like to try before because I needed it all done and dusted before August 2021. It was my choice!! Ok I wasn’t that confident but I was learning from ICS’s online resources and my CGP green book (best purchase ever) I booked my exam contacting a exam centre as an external candidate at a academy 1hr from me!! The exam cost £98 for both papers. So I completed both exams one on 8th & 13th January 2021 (yikes) both exam papers were not as bad as I thought., confident not really but I at to try!! Three months later March 4th 2021 I receive a email congratulationing me on passing Biology (4) C. To say I was pleased was an understatement but I have ICS to thank for the advice, mock paper marks and advice to work on areas I found hard.

Contra: The marking system of assignments was changed back in November 2020, and at first it was difficult to get answers from the support tutors. It caused some frustration. Otherwise, previously, I received the necessary support from the tutors.
Pro: When the marking tutors received the assignment, they all marked it really fast and provided a meaningful and highly professional feedback on each of the questions. 
Summary: I was satisfied generally with the service they provided. Customer service was also available and helpful when I needed them.
Development point: Maybe, it would be good to consider to provide some kind of access to each of the resources per unit, not only to two books- if I would have wanted to buy all the books, it would have costed me a fortune & it took long as well to find the articles on the internet.",Person,,Andi Papp,https://uk.trustpilot.com/users/5d1cfe63d931bbd177071c54,Thing,ICS Learn,Organization,Trustpilot,https://uk.trustpilot.com,Rating,4

Initially, I thought it would be challenging and tough to complete. I went nicely with great tutors/assessors for their advice and assignment feedback. Some are exceptionally well at assisting on queries and marking the assignment with due diligence and fast, within 40 minutes! It would have been a great course if it had accommodated practical HR models and case studies across the organizations in modules instead of emphasizing theories.  However, lately introduced Tutor support was too slow to respond to the queries, literally unhelpful on the question asked to them.

A lot of the course is just waiting to hear back from your tutors. 

Throughout my course I’d say out of the 4 tutors I had, only 1 was very good. The others didn’t seem to care too much. Rather than actually tutor someone they came across as disinterested and unhelpful. 

I was told 5 times one particular assignment couldn’t be graded because I didn’t follow certain rules. 

That’s fine, but at least tutor me properly and tell me what these rules are rather than just a generic message because I obviously wasn’t understanding what was required. This wasted 3 weeks of my time.

I really enjoyed the flexible approach to learning that they offer, which was perfect whilst I worked full-time. The content was engaging and the tutor support was efficient and effective in helping me to achieve my goal. 

I think my only criticism of the experience is in regards to the online classes. Some tutors would speak endlessly about ICS Learn and then only cover the content of the class in the remaining 20 minutes. I felt that time could have been better spent going into detail about the content. Additionally, the recordings of online classrooms were rarely uploaded promptly as outlined by tutors. 

Overall, the experience was excellent and I’d recommend ICS Learn for anyone considering a CIPD qualification.",Person,,customer,https://uk.trustpilot.com/users/5bea9027c88145d26c2e30bc,Thing,ICS Learn,Organization,Trustpilot,https://uk.trustpilot.com,Rating,5

The sales/course  advisors are deadbeats who really should be re-educating themselves instead of preying on many vulnerable people.

There were supporting materials for the units, but once I learned how to find them I felt they could have been listed in a clearer way to make it easier to find the material linked to the question I was answering. 
The live classrooms felt like an absolute waste of time and not sure why you have to attend to pass the unit. 
Keith Watson’s ones felt the most informative, other tutors just read out the slides and acted like reading the learning outcomes aloud was going to help you with your assignment. 
There was little to no advice on structure at the beginning of the course and this is something I felt really held me back, I had no confidence to get started when I didn’t know how to. 
I didn’t actually contact the tutors at all and used a Facebook group and internet searches to assist me, there have been a lot of complaints on the facebook group that you now can’t contact the tutors directly and answering times for queries have increased.",Person,,Georgia Torres,https://uk.trustpilot.com/users/5b82ce644de5666d34132c37,Thing,ICS Learn,Organization,Trustpilot,https://uk.trustpilot.com,Rating,3

Whilst the course was very informative, and the tutors supportive with quick response times, I felt the course was heavily theoretical and lacked a link to the real world of HR. Maybe a mandatory mentor through CIPD would be a good idea? Also, if considering the course, bear in mind that once you have successfully completed your coursework you have to contact ICS Learn to get your certificate, it will not be sent to you automatically, as I mistakenly thought. After 4 months of waiting, I decided to submit an enquiry and have been informed my assignments have to be vetted again by the Quality Assurance Team (10 days), submitted to CIPD (4-6 weeks) and then I will have to wait for the CIPD to send me my certificate (8-10 weeks), which is not the best.

I try to sit in on as many of the live sessions as I can, most of which are hosted by the  ICS in-house Maths Teacher Melissa Lieberman.  Melissa is a fantastic tutor and always makes the sessions very interesting but also easy to follow, the three recent sessions I want to say thank you for are Quadratic Equations, Simultaneous Equations and Re-arranging Formula. These are complex topics but Melissa made them easy to follow and I now have a much better understanding of them.  

Also of note is that ICS have arranged for mock exams for Students to sit remotely which also get proctored via webcam, these mock exams are marked by a recognised expert organisation.  This is a fantastic initiative by ICS Learn which will help to give the students confidence in their learning.

By the time the balance of the course was paid off I had not finished the course. I work full time and the idea of this course was that it was to fit around my work. 

So why have I been told that, despite paying in full for the course, I will now have to pay over £200 to continue studying? They sent me a list of prices which went up to a 6 month extension for over £200! They said I had to pay all these extra fees in order to carry on with the course and to regain access to my online account. I hardly used the support of the tutors anyway so I'm very annoyed that after having paid over a grand for this course that I am now being expected to pay extra to complete it!?

I may have taken my time, but again, isn't the idea of this kind of course to do it when you can? Surely now that I have paid the full balance I should be able to return to it whenever I like? I understand having to pay for using the services of the tutors, but I would quite happily continue doing my course, being able to book my exams without the tutors. This I was told was not an option.

The prices for the courses are reasonable and the material is clear and easy to follow. The student interface is easy to use and manoeuvre around, making the whole experience a smooth one. If there is any technical updates to be made to the website announcements are made well in advance, so you can plan your studies around this. All announcements are clearly visible on the front dashboard and there is a space for students to discuss concerns with each other, which helps to avoid feeling isolated. The study plan is broken down into manageable chunks, which is ideal if you are working whilst studying these courses. I am personally someone who is comfortable with distance learning, so if you are self motivated and driven this is a great service to use!",Person,,Danielle Short,https://uk.trustpilot.com/users/5539233f0000ff0001ba569b,Thing,ICS Learn,Organization,Trustpilot,https://uk.trustpilot.com,Rating,5

However, I did want to provide a more indepth review of ICS Learn beyond the positive comments of the registration process.

I have read some negative online reviews from students about ICS Learn.  I have to admit to being baffled by it as my own experience has been the opposite.  

I studied with ICS Learn for my AAT Level 2 in Accounting and found their online material very good, so much so I passed with a distinction. 

I love the mini knowledge checks at the end of each section within a module, the online assessments and the tutor marked assessments which helps you understand the areas you need to further work on.  

Perhaps it was because I was a mature student that I didn't need a huge amount of tutor support but when I did reach out to my tutor, the feedback was always supportive, encouraging and positive.  

I did consider going to another online provider for my AAT Level 3.  
However, after research and most notably as I was really impressed with my experience with them, I decided to continue with them for my AAT Level 3.  

Why change providers when you are happy right?",Person,,Blueberry Taylor,https://uk.trustpilot.com/users/600d4c7bd1f93c00195ce043,Thing,ICS Learn,Organization,Trustpilot,https://uk.trustpilot.com,Rating,5

None of their staff appear to have had any training on how to deal with people with learning differences.  When you phone or email to explain the challenges you're experiencing, and the adjustments you would like making, they are very dismissive and speak down to you as though you're stupid for not being able to manage what they feel are simple things.  As somebody who has achieved degree level qualifications through the Open University I know I am fully capable of distance learning complex subjects but as somebody with a learning difference, there are things that seem simple to neurotypical people that I really struggle with and need additional support for, or allowances making.  It is absolutely shocking that in this day and age, a business that is teaching CIPD qualifications, and supposedly best practices in relation to the Equality Act, disability discrimination, and reasonable adjustments, can treat people so badly.  I feel completely demoralised and let down and am nearly £2000 out of pocket with nothing to show for it and seemingly no recourse and ICS couldn't care less about the distress they have caused me.",Person,,Liz,https://uk.trustpilot.com/users/597236e70000ff000ab21a95,Thing,ICS Learn,Organization,Trustpilot,https://uk.trustpilot.com,Rating,1

Despite ICS saying that the site is easy to navigate at times it was not and I spent a lot of time looking for certain things that should have been easy to find. One of the main things I did not enjoy about the course is the time it takes for tutors to come back to you when you submit a question or require information. You are provided a turn around time however this caused so much delay through my studies that toward the end I was spinning 3 different plates as I was waiting for a response and couldn't move forward until I had a response. ICS did however in the last few months communicate that there was a delay with response's due to the COVID pandemic.
When I did receive a response from the tutors, they would not answer the questions fully or provide the information needed meaning I would have to the re-submit another enquiry to get the information I needed  which caused more delays and put me back another 3-5 days! This happened on more than one occasion and almost on every unit. I found it really unhelpful during my studies. There was only one tutor that was so thorough and helpful with her feedback and information so I was sad to see her leave ICS. I also found that at times the criteria for the assignment's were not always clear and it was vague as to what you needed to do to pass which left you baffled however the online classrooms were helpful!

My experience with ICS has been nothing but positive and I enjoyed the fact that they allow you to work on your own pace. This proved to be especially useful in dynamic circumstances when I didn`t have so much time to spend on studying and I could then easily catch up and complete my assignments when I had more free time. Having a strict deadline is good but it is sometimes extremely stressful when you have to balance out between full time job, studying and other events that might happen in your life. So, I like the fact that ICS allows us to work on our own pace. The tutors have been all really helpful. There were times when I needed a bit more explanation on certain things and in such cases I would recommend you ask specific and detailed questions. The student services support team were always very helpful too, I cannot fault them at all. There was a time when they even helped me find out information which would usually be better known to the tutors but the advisors made that extra effort to give me the info as quick as possible. I enjoyed the fact that I had free access to two books, however, I think this has changed and the new students would not be able to access those for free. So, a little recommendation to ICS is to bring back the free access to those books as they were really helpful in structuring the assignments and just to get clearer understanding of the topics.

A little disappointing final experience with ICS Learn - after receiving my results for my final exam, and now having passed each module of my CIPD qualification, I received no communication from ICS Learn to let me know it was complete. I had to email them to understand what the next steps were which seemed to trigger them to organise for my results to be checked and my certificate arranged. In my opinion, this shouldn't be down to the student to arrange - I think the learning provider should update students on next steps as soon as final results have been released.",Person,,Jennifer,https://uk.trustpilot.com/users/5eff3f99116d84a53ffae86f,Thing,ICS Learn,Organization,Trustpilot,https://uk.trustpilot.com,Rating,4

With another I felt like I'm coming in the middle of the lesson and missed something, so have to read everything twice or using additional learning sources, so is pointlessly when you are spending thousand quid and still have to rely on additional sourcing.
However, giving the opportunity to complete an assessment once again if you have failed.

Took a long time to receive my Diploma, but not sure if that's their fault or CIPD.

While Ciaran was easy to deal with, the enrollment was seamless and I was 'set up' quickly, the problems started once I got stuck in. 
I've 2 pieces of feedback here and I'll try to keep this brief:
1) the support tutors for the course are non existent. My opinion here is because so many people signed up recently, the tutors now look to have about 60 students each and they cannot cope with the volume of student queries so its taking 1 week+ to get any kind of reply, which dramatically slows down course progress.

2) I've started to get threatening emails from ICS credit control as THEY have not set up my monthly direct debit correctly and my account is 25 days overdue. I've spent the last week sending my DD mandate form to their Credit Control team multiple times and nobody has followed up to confirm they've set it up. They've now threatened to transfer my account to a debt collection agency.

This company is really struggling to cope with demand, their tutors are overwhelmed so take ages to reply and you effectively have to struggle through the course on your own. 

I hope this review helps someone because all of the 5 star reviews are not representing the true image of ICS as it is right now.",Person,https://user-images.trustpilot.com/5fba23f7cd6931001942ac73/73x73.png,Lorraine King,https://uk.trustpilot.com/users/5fba23f7cd6931001942ac73,Thing,ICS Learn,Organization,Trustpilot,https://uk.trustpilot.com,Rating,1

So I did a bit of futher research.. and I'm really glad I did! 
All the 5 stars reviews on Trustpilot are reviews from people that just started the course and they just talk about how easy is to enrol, but if you look well you'll notice that there are plenty of negative reviews regarding the actual tutoring and regarding the fact that you are not at all followed and supported throughout your studies.

Do not do this if you would like help and advice when you require it, you have to email your tutor and wait for them to arrange a slot to call or an email back on advice. 

I took this up with the team as I didn’t progress in the 8 months I was signed up, it left me confused and frustrated. I believe they class it as ‘distance learning’ and it’s certainly not something that suits Me. I wish They explained this type of learning as it all seems amazing with a portal etc but that is the main part you need, support and someone to help you. I thought there would be at least a student line Between usual work hours for someone to be there to answer queries, as let’s face it there’s an office with plenty of staff administrating the join ups! 

I contested the cancellation fee as if paid enough in the time I was signed up and the response I got was:

“Whilst I understand the desire to have a quick answer to a query, waiting for one or two days for your tutor to respond is not unreasonable.

Therefore, the conclusion arrived at is that there has been no breach of service”

I will say the presentations/quizzes are good & they do have group lessons which were handy but when you have a question, it halts your learning until it’s answered therefore I do not think it’s worth it.

If you don’t like the sound of this type of thing then I’d go more down the route or getting a tutor, spend your money wisely especially during these times!",Person,,Ell Hales,https://uk.trustpilot.com/users/5e8c71b99ba9f5624d4e3a37,Thing,ICS Learn,Organization,Trustpilot,https://uk.trustpilot.com,Rating,2

ICS provided access to the CIPS E-Book and E-learning for all 8-modules (which is worth £300) as well as some powerpoint slides and a practice test. You also have access to a tutor who is very knowledgable and fast to respond. 

Prior to starting modules 1 and 2, I had telephone conversations with my tutor but didn't really gain much from them and and so I didn't bother thereafter. Also, the ICS learning material is not very good and so I pretty much relied on the CIPS E-Book and E-Learning as well as free revison material on YouTube.

However, the key to passing the CIPS Diploma exams is by taking as many practice tests as possible, and in my opinion, the ten questions provided by ICS for each module are not enough. 

ICS need to overhaul the CIPS Diploma course and add some genuine learning material (not just powerpoint slides) and at least 100 practice questions per module. Unless this happens, I suggest CIPS students self-study and put their money towards the CIPS membership and exam fees which are not paid by ICS.",Person,,Edward,https://uk.trustpilot.com/users/5fa5a828ea3b3c0019abc517,Thing,ICS Learn,Organization,Trustpilot,https://uk.trustpilot.com,Rating,2

When I was working through my bookkeeping course I found that the system kept resetting my progress every time I logged out. On enquiring about this the first time I wasn`t given a straight answer, I was just told that everything seemed to be in place for my course and I should use Google Chrome.  I purchased a new laptop believing that my old laptop may have been the issue only for the problem to continue. It wasn`t until I queried this a second time that I was told that the system resets progress automatically to help with revision. Very frustrating that I was not told this the first time around. 
The course that I was studying was with AAT and due to Covid-19 the assessment centres all closed before I was able to sit my two assessments. My support period with ICS Learn was due to end in May but I received notification from AAT that my AAT membership had been extended until the end of October. When the assessment centres re-opened I tried to access my course on ICS Learn to revise only to find it gone. When I contacted ICS Learn and asked why my course was not visible when my time to sit my assessments had been extended I was told that the extension from AAT did not apply to my course access with ICS Learn and was given a list of fees that I would have to pay to extend my support period. I was surprised that ICS Learn did not work hand in hand with AAT given that they are a training provider for AAT courses. It wasn`t until I challenged ICS Learn about why I should have to pay an extension fee when I was unable to sit my assessments through no fault of my own that they agreed to extend my support period free of charge. 
Their system also does not appear to work properly, it marks answers wrong when they are right.

1151,Review,2020-10-06T08:16:39+00:00,CIPD Level 5 Diploma,en,"I completed my CIPD Level 5 Diploma through ICS Learn and the experience was a mixed bag. First and foremost, this style of learning is perfect for those who learn at their own pace, possibly alongside full-time employment, and can cope with limited contact time from tutors. Unlike some other providers there is no deadline for each module, you have one deadline (18 or so months) by which point all assignments need to have passed. This allows you to get lots done at busy times and put the qualification aside when things are busier in your home/personal life.
For someone who is really looking to understand HR in depth and get the most out of their learning experience I would not recommend this service; you have one 60-90 minute seminar per module and can then email tutors separately. Although tutors are largely supportive and responsive, I do not think one hour per module is good value for money given the cost of the course. 
My other major concern with the course was the outdated nature of some of the materials; it looked like some modules had not had their content updated for several years (some referred to the upcoming Brexit referendum...) and this is not great in an area like HR, when standard practice and legislation are changing constantly. 
To conclude, ICS Learn are, for this course at least, perfect if you are 'just' looking to get the qualification. If you are looking to really enjoy your HR learning and need regular touch points with tutors I would recommend reaching out to other providers.",Person,,Patrick,https://uk.trustpilot.com/users/5f7c27cfd8a77f0016b4be66,Thing,ICS Learn,Organization,Trustpilot,https://uk.trustpilot.com,Rating,3

I decided on Accountancy and looked online at AAT's website to see who would be available to teach the course long-distance and had initially had the plan to study with a local institution. That's when I came across ICS Learn. Out of all the providers I had sent an email to, not only were ICS Learn the most responsive but they had the best choice of courses available. The minute I had my course advisor Anne-Marie get in touch, I trusted her from the start and she gave me only the necessary information regarding my choice. There was no hard-sell, just genuine commitment to have me sign up for the right course. She is a big reason behind why it was so easy to choose ICS as my course provider. I've already jumped into the course now that I've signed up and I'm excited for the future and where my career can go.

I found my overall experience to be good and it is likely that I would recommend ICS Learn to a friend/do another course through ICS Learn, but what really lets it down is the portal.

Navigating through the portal was extremely tiresome. Not all information is in one place and I often needed to click around for 15 to 30 minutes just to find all the information I needed. 

For example, some topics are saved under ""Getting started with your course"" and some topics I would have expected to find under this heading were under ""Connect and Communicate"", e.g. the the induction webinar. There is a link to the induction webinar under ""Getting started with your course"", but it takes you to a different page with not the same resources. 

Overall, the portal is a real maze and it was extremely frustrating to find the resources I needed easily.

However, the tutors and student support were excellent.",Person,,CH,https://uk.trustpilot.com/users/5f7597522480d0fd41c92e9e,Thing,ICS Learn,Organization,Trustpilot,https://uk.trustpilot.com,Rating,4

I decided to take the plunge and enrol. I was contact by phone call explaining how much the costs would be and I was offered an interest free payment plan over 6 month which was very helpful. Once I paid my first instalment. I was sent log in details and given basic information about the course and some study tips. I was also contacted by my next support tutor who again gave study tips and offer help throughout my course.

The online portal is very easy to use. The course is layout in units and each unit is broken down into sections. It refers to the text book which they recommend you purchase to enforce their text on each study. However I believe you could get through the course without the book if you really wanted as they provide good details.

After I complete my course I will look into studying with ICS again just because I enjoy learning.",Person,,Matt,https://uk.trustpilot.com/users/5ee0bc491af627e658b29174,Thing,ICS Learn,Organization,Trustpilot,https://uk.trustpilot.com,Rating,5

Now ready to resume studies, ICS Learn has told him he’s only got 5 weeks to complete the course, despite having 14/15 weeks left when he suspended the studies.

On another matter I decided to 'Crack' on, and have received little to no help, my tutor at first took 3 days to respond, just recently the response has improved but not the support, all they send it print off work sheets, at one stage they sent me 70 pages to print off!! no use to me at all, also how will I know if the answers are right. 
Computer tests are so sensitive it keeps telling me that the whole question is wrong, and I spend 20 minutes analyzing it to find there isn't an N/A in the correct box!
At my wits end as at one stage tutor told me not to worry if answers were coming back incorrect if I couldn't see why.. I mean what??  
and I really wouldn't  recommend at this stage I'm seriously worried I have totally wasted my money and will end up having to enroll with another provider just for my own sanity.

- To conclude to the reply I have had from this message, I can indeed prove that the material I was sent was for printing and not editable if you would like to supply an email address for me to forward these documents onto, I would also like to add my course tutor has told me that with a net value of 165.833333 r I am supposed to 'Round up' because vat has to be rounded down - I am seriously worried about the peopl;e qualified to 'teach' or maybe it is that your material is not at all fir for purpose.

Both my Human Biology and Mathematics teachers were there on hand to answer any question. Often providing me with extra questions and material along with links to further reading and research. 

However, it was during the crisis when they truly showed their desire to see their students cross the line, by going that extra yard, ensuring that we all got assessed and graded and in the end, passing the exams required. Online exams in my home and phone calls from tutors made this possible.

A big thanks to my tutors, my Human Biology tutor was unstoppable with support and extra help. My maths tutor provided me with the confidence to re-enter the adult classroom and come top, every time in each mock exam. The exams admissions team worked tirelessly to get me across the line, I am now a trainee teacher.

1318,Review,2020-08-19T16:52:17+00:00,UPDATED - Price doesn't reflect quality of course or tutoring…,en,"Previously had a good experience of completing one unit of the course. Hence why I then chose ICS to complete the full CIPD course with. Initial sign up is excellent, cost of course explained etc. 
However I've been incredibly disappointed with my experience so far. Every interaction with Student Services or tutor seems to involve being quoted SLA constantly (perhaps I need to quote the £2500 fee I paid), the tutor seems to respond within the SLA but the content is so vague it means my reply then takes another 2 days to respond to. Tutor also had the audacity to quote SLA to me when I chased a response to assignment (which was 5 days over SLA). Appreciate it's distance learning, but if I added up how much time is taken with delays, it would probably amount to a month of the course.
Some of the course content doesn't correlate with the assessment criteria, nor does the lesson content between tutors. I really feel like I've been mis sold this course and the tutors don't get pulled up on poor and late responses because they are a selling point to promote the course. I get absolutely no support from Student Services and they always seem very evasive when I ask for a contact at Curriculum Support. 
If I wouldn't lose so much money, I'd sign up for the course elsewhere!

UPDATE - I thought it would make sense to update my previous review with one less star (unfortunately you have to select at least one). The level of support and service has dropped even lower in the last couple of months. It appears that ICS are still charging people full price for courses, while decreasing the availability of tutor support, by assigning each person a ""support tutor"". That's if you get a response. Appreciate it's not immediate response, but waiting 5+ days for a response on a question relating to a unit isn't helpful or conducive to passing an assignment. I've recently extended my support period, but will certainly be putting in a request for it to be extended further to make up for the delays (not out of my pocket - £3000 down and still not getting what I paid for). The two hour drop in sessions are also completely pointless and sporadic.  The course discusses HR professionalism constantly. It's a shame that the provider didn't practice what they preach! I'm not the only one to think this and am regularly seeing complaints from fellow students on the same issues. Hopefully CIPD will eventually drop them as a provider of their courses, because their representation is terrible!",Person,,F,https://uk.trustpilot.com/users/5f3d589329878d802239ab85,Thing,ICS Learn,Organization,Trustpilot,https://uk.trustpilot.com,Rating,1

- The portal - this was very difficult to navigate alone without any guidance. I know there is an initial video you watch however it doesn't make sense where things are located. I feel everything for that unit should be in the same place not 3/4
- Tutors - i feel some of my tutors were not as receptive to me asking questions and came across abrupt in their communications. As learners are learning remotely i didn't find this useful at all. 
- Communication - at the end of my journey i had to message a tutor to understand what i had to do (ie call the student services) - i feel some more guidance on what to do at the end of the programme would be beneficial
- Live webinars - i had one live webinar that started at 7pm and didn't finish until 8:20pm! Most of the information given was not relevant to the task and i was more confused then when i joined. This meant i spent longer than i wanted trying to understand the unit and assignment. 
Due to some of these things i was put off completing this course and it is only hat i was furloughed for 4 months that i actually found the motivation to understand and complete it. 
I know some of the above has been negative however i would like to point our 2 of my tutors Wendy Chippendale and Leigh Hinshelwood. Both of these tutors supported and inspired me throughout my journey and i am very grateful for that. These two tutors alongside my own work, gave me the confidence to feel comfortable being an L&D professional. I want to say a personal thank you to them both!

The online resources for the AAT qualifications is awful compared to rivals, the tutors email once and you never hear from them again, there seems to be no drive from them to help you succeed other than when they want your money to sign up. Like most companies they bury all the stuff in terms and conditions, then when you cancel they unfairly penalise you - Like having to pay the full AAT membership fee when cancelling even though you e only used it for a month. Certainly look for better Accountancy learning providers like Accountancy Learning Ltd - I have been with them for a month and my tutor had emailed me atleast 5 times offering help. They have more of a family run business feel where the customer/student is actually important to them, not a mechanism like ICS to take your money and deliver nothing. Overall, Avoid ICS - there are better providers for your money.


Response to ICS on their reply: your insinuation that I am not compatible with online learning is laughable.

Having researched different online providers I was drawn straight away to ICS Learn specifically due to the score and numerous reviews on Trustpilot.

Having a busy full time job with a young family, ICS's online platform and support network provided me the flexibility that I desperately needed to succeed on the course. Working at my own pace I soon found a rhythm and work pattern that enabled me to complete the materials and submit test papers, mock exams and complete the NEA. During this unprecedented and unpredictable year I can't speak highly enough of the support I received; special mention to my tutor Gordon, curriculum leader Melanie and the exam support team.

With the completion of my A level, I am now able to celebrate achieving a grade B, and moving onto my History PGCE in September!

I decided to embark on my CIPS and, I thought at the time, would go it alone, but I was mistaken. When you study with ICS you don't do it alone. ICS offer all the support you want and need. I promise you, you won't be disappointed or dissatisfied. Distance learning with a difference.

You get given more than enough resources to go away and complete and tips to free websites and even demonstrations on how to use those sites, so even if you aren't computer savvy you still get support in that area. you can message your course tutor or post your query on a forum and get answers that way. You can start right away from when you sign up, without waiting around for standard start dates like in colleges. 
Honestly, I was dubious at first and always saw myself as someone who needed to be taught in a classroom environment. I just set time aside through the week and just get on with the work then, you have access to the course for 2 years with friendly tutors just a click or phone call away.

So i asked for a payment break of three months. I was not in the emotional state to deal with this. 
Then i have been made redundant recently. I have no money to pay my rent or utility bills... What they did instead is lower it to £50. If i have NO money, and may be facing homelessness. How will i make £50 appear for a course i didnt use?! 

Yet the company are still asking for me to pay the fee at the end of the month or my standing order will go ahead. 

Mid mental health breakdown l call the office to explain that i will have to borrow money, crying and inconsolable explaining that i am completely stuffed at the moment.

1460,Review,2020-07-04T10:44:08+00:00,"Good course content, crap learner experience",en,"The content of the course has been good, but the learner experience has been really poor. It doesn't help that I am doing a Learning and Development Award at a time when we are seeing an explosion in innovative on-line learning platforms while ICS seems stuck somewhere in the early noughties. 

Particularly surprising and annoying has been the total lack of a bibliography for any of the learning materials, despite my repeat requests for them. I'm sure this is breaking intellectual property rules. When I queried it with my tutor I was told to simply go and 'google it'! Because of course most academics only produce one paper per year?!?! Really, really poor - if I was an academic and knew my work wasn't being referenced properly so an on-line learning provider could get rich quick I would be really unimpressed. I have raised this with both by tutor and ICS direct and still have yet to receive a satisfactory response. 

Some of the generic learning guidance along with course text was littered with typos, some of it so bad that it didn't really make any sense. When I raised this with ICS, I was just told 'thanks for letting us know'. Clearly zero quality checking of material going on. 

A completely transactional relationship with the tutor. Short, one-line replies. An introductory phone call would take 10 minutes. 

I recognise that on-line learning is a different mode and should be entirely  self-directed, but ICS need to keep up with the learning landscape and see what the likes of Coursera and others are up to if they want to hold on to their learners.",Person,,Lucy O'Melia,https://uk.trustpilot.com/users/5f005d1d58d8a712328283a9,Thing,ICS Learn,Organization,Trustpilot,https://uk.trustpilot.com,Rating,2

I would like to specifically highlight the great support I got during the two exams for the course. On the day of the exams I was extremely nervous and unwell but the exam assistant, Nicola (exam centre in Edinburgh) went above and beyond to make sure I was okay and really settled my nerves. I don’t think I would have gotten through the exams without that support so I’m extremely grateful for that! The whole process of registering for exams was straight forward and well explained too. 

I do feel that having to contact your tutor through email for support can slow down the process significantly which is not ideal if you have timescales you’re looking to keep to but I understand that a function such as live chat may not be possible given the tutors’ other commitments. I also feel that sometimes the feedback given or your questions are a bit lost in translation so some facility to have a chat over the phone would have been beneficial for me. 

There was also an occasion where the course materials were not updated and one of the assessments asked you to read a source that was no longer available so this caused some confusion. 

Overall the dashboard and platform was really easy to use and I liked the flexibility you have in terms of which modules you do and when.

The course is structured so that you can manage your own time and choose when to submit your assignments. When I initially enrolled I thought that this would be the best structure for me however I found that ended up delaying my studies and only completing my assignments within the last 6 months of my course. This was obviously my own fault but I feel that a more structured system with unit deadlines would have been more appropriate for me. 
The system itself is currently being updated and is becoming much more userfriendly which is great. The quality of the content varies between each unit but I have found most of it useful when studying for my assignments.
I haven't used the tutor support feature much but when I did I received a quick response.

In essence, it's no wonder as to why or how they have become Britain's leading online learning provider; since, there are a multitude of factors which are unique to ICS Learn - which also includes their excellent customer Service; their Customer Advisors are always informative and polite, but never rude, pushy and just target driven.",Person,,Dominic Favourites,https://uk.trustpilot.com/users/5cfa358b400f6fb5392bbd98,Thing,ICS Learn,Organization,Trustpilot,https://uk.trustpilot.com,Rating,5

Getting signed up was really easy, took only the deposit being paid, and the admin team were enormously helpful, warm and welcoming, answering questions and offering guidance on getting the payments set up as well. As soon as I signed up I got a flurry of emails with a welcome, personal introduction from the tutor and all the details I needed to get signed in to the website. The way the content is set up, you can easily follow the lessons and there are plenty of practice questions if you need them.

The powerpoints which contain the information are of extremely bad quality making it difficult to read, there are numerous spelling mistakes, numerous errors regarding the page numbers in textbooks you are supposed to read, repeated information where it has been cut and pasted incorrectly, wrong words used for titles and sections i.e. describing quantitative research but saying qualitative research and some of the answers on the self check questions are wrong and contradict what they have written earlier. With the constant errors and mistakes found, it makes me question the validity of what I am learning and whether I am learning incorrect information that will lead me to not pass my exams.

Ciaran was quick to respond to my queries and was very helpful when explaining the enrolment process, course content, and payments. When delivering advice on which level of the course to take, Ciaran suggested going with the lv.5 instead of the lv.3 course, due to the fact that I already had a lv.3 qualification in HR practice, however since I do not have experience in L&D, I decided it would be more beneficial to get a foundation of learning in this first before developing further. As such, this is the only recommendation I would make for improvement. 

When taking the payment over the phone, Ciaran explained everything again and confirmed that I am happy to proceed. There was a system error the first time I entered my details and Ciaran was able to calmly rearrange for the payment to be attempted again, which was successful.

I was stuck between AVADO and ICS Learn, when I spoke to AVADO they seemed so pushy and tried to keep getting me to sign up without making sure i had all my questions answered. The service Paul gave me and how he explained everything (not to forget the price was also great) sold it to me to choose ICS Learn. 

I did my research I looked at how many reviews ICS had compared to others and not only is their rating good they have thousands more than other providers.

Everything is straight forward and simple to follow. only been a few days but everything seems so easy and tutor has already been in touch over the weekend I was expecting it to take longer but such quick service!

The number of online recorded lessons is 1 revision lesson per module. Sometimes these last as little as 30 minutes. For several months worth of content that was really not enough. It often felt like I was studying alone and teaching myself. There could be a lot more interactivity ie there are barely any you tube videos,  there could be more pictures and should be more recorded lessons. For example, there should be 1 online lesson for each of the 7 parts within a module at least.

Sometimes I found the online textbooks difficult to find/read on the screen but this was also personal preference.

Started off really excited to begin my course with ics learn. First few months was ok then it began to go downhill. Overall I had 4 tutors, was left weeks without knowing anything as to why my tutors was not answering emails to then receive an email from someone completely new saying they are my tutor and wanted to start fresh, starting fresh 4 times is quite tedious. I think 2 of my tutors was made redundant but no explanation. After complaining waiting a few more weeks I then found out it changed to Babington. They wanted me to re-enrol which was fine, done the 45 minute phone call, filled out all forms and my line manager done there bit. Few weeks into it received an email saying lets get you enrolled and fill out the forms and get you booked in for 45 min phone call.....erm what. At this point I then complained and have taken myself off the course despite being half way through to find a more efficient provider. Stephen L was the tutor to mark my work, unsure why as it took him 7 weeks to mark 2 parts of my unit. No help what so ever and never got back to my emails asking for help with simple questions.

I've studied with other organisations before, i've never come accros such T&C's . The reason i signed up was because of the flexibility to work at your own pace. I was told I would still be able to complete my course once the support timescale will expire but now I'm being told that what they call ""Support"" is inclusive of the course materials and there are extra fees to gain access again. I understood support means - Tutors assistant not the actual course. 
So basiscally i'm paying big fees for something that i don't have access.

I didn't really know much about it to be honest but I did know the route I wanted to go down was bookkeeping so I started there. 

I made an enquiry and was dealt with by a lady named Anne Marie, she was extremely helpful and patient answering all of the questions that I had and taking time to respond in detail. Most importantly she sent me a link to test my knowledge before I decided which level to go for and I am so glad that she did as it resulted in me choosing the right course to study at a level that is suited to me. 

The course is incredibly flexible, you can stop and start any time you like and it works perfectly around my job and other aspects of my life. I have been out of studying for 8 years so I'm glad they also start you off easy with simple numeracy and literacy skills just to help jog your memory and get your brain used to working in that capacity again.

I haven't yet finished the course so have no idea where it will take me career wise but after speaking to people in relation to it in some roles I have found that it is really well sought after and something that you should definitely undertake if you have the time to spare!

Overall, I am happy with how easy it was to set everything up, I was literally studying the next again day, and also how friendly the service was, a huge thanks to Anne Marie for all her support throughout, I would definitely recommend!",Person,,Tammy,https://uk.trustpilot.com/users/5df410397e8d915827723173,Thing,ICS Learn,Organization,Trustpilot,https://uk.trustpilot.com,Rating,5

I have paid tuition fees to ICS therefore ICS must take responsibility to ensure that students get their certificate upon completion of the course. It's your responsibility to communicate with CIPD and resolve the issue. Students shouldn't suffer due to negligence of CIPD. If you don't have authority to directly communicate with CIPD than you have no authority to take tuition fees from the students. I am simply not interested in any of your justification. I am going to spread it all over social media to let students know the reality of ICS. I have already communicated with local authorities to blacklist your operation in the region and considering appropriate legal action.

Called today to register for a course I'd made enquiries about, all signed up and email sent to access my learning material only to find I had been signed up for a different course from what I asked!

Maybe it is the call centre operative who needs to do some learning! A key skill of the job is to listen, she clearly did not!

Not a great start. My advice to anyone else, make sure you are listened to!

REVISED:
Further to my initial two star rating, having spoken with Shelia this morning, I have taken solace in her actions and felt the need to upgrade my rating to four stars. Shelia listened to the issue and took corrective action to help me in a proactive manner. Thank you Shelia for giving me some confidence back.

Interactive content that is not that interactive, a clunky makeover of moodle at best, learning materials all over the place and difficult to utilise, not to mention changing every time you log in. Reference material also changes or moves location, if you have not finished a module or assignment don't expect to find your reference material in the same place or for it to be the same material or even there at all! 

All in all, a positive sales team backed by a poor LMS, and poorly motivated tutors who do little to advise or support you through the programme. Be cautious as the requirements will probably change as did mine for the CIPD level 5 Diploma in L&D notwithstanding the reduction in the amount of attempts at submission you were allowed, please be advised to look around before committing your time, money and effort.",Person,,Lee French,https://uk.trustpilot.com/users/5abb7a1e4de5666d3410fb78,Thing,ICS Learn,Organization,Trustpilot,https://uk.trustpilot.com,Rating,1

The actual course material was often out of date or not particularly useful. It often contradicted what the tutors wanted, and therefore I wasted time with some assignments.  More time should be spend updating the course material and making it more relevant for the unit, assignments and learning.",Person,,Lauren ,https://uk.trustpilot.com/users/542ff52900006400018e3144,Thing,ICS Learn,Organization,Trustpilot,https://uk.trustpilot.com,Rating,3

2456,Review,2019-11-30T10:58:03+00:00,Borderline scam,en,"The reviews about the enrolment service are there because they ask, or in other words 'beg' for it. I think people who do these reviews forget that those working in the enrolment progresses, are trained to do so, and make you buy the product. 
I have to say I was incredibly optimistic about studying with ICS Learn after speaking to the student advisors, having their reassurance about the content of the course - being ensured it included 'extensive feedback', and 'interactive quizzes' (where?) It absolutely does not, and I will add at this point the advisor knew exactly which course I wished to be enrolled in so you can't say ""they may offer interactive quizzes on some courses!"" and extensive feedback is nonsense. 
Also, when I first paid my deposit for the course ('deposit' = not what it usually means, it is just the upfront payment, you do not get it back) I was denied access to the services for over 24 hours due to a 'technical error', even though I was promised my login details within an hour. When I did eventually get access, my tutor went on holiday the next day, for I believe it was 10 days - meaning I couldn't interact with her during most of the trial period. I have now been with ICS for (I believe) almost 3 months. For me, at the time, this was not an issue, but now I see it as incredibly unproffessional (not the holiday, but the technical issue, as I was not informed about the lack of my login details, I had to enquire about them myself when I didn't recieve them for 3 hours, it was only then I was informed that they had a techincal issue and I might not get the details for another '24 hours' - apparently this was information they had known the moment I had paid, but yet they did not tell me about. I was also not given any extra trial period despite not being able to use their services properly for first, the 24 hours I waited for my login, and then the 10 days my tutor was away)
I understand the method of contacting your tutors yourself, as I have done on a few occasions. But my tutors replies are so short, as if I am wasting her time by even contacting her, she regularly ignores about half my questions, and doesn't seem interested in the slightest to make any sort of encouragement, conversation or even give advice outside of a very basic response to a single question out of the few I ask. It makes me nervous to contact her, I sometimes even forget I am paying almost £300+ for this service. I have yet to send in a mock exam for marking, as my computer has been broken. But I have one ready to send, and, based on the reviews regarding how they mark their mock exams, and based on my experience with my tutor - I do not have high hopes that this will give me any insight at all into how I am progressing with the course. 
Aside from tutor support being a major issue, and the advisors exaggerating what exactly ICS offer. The actual content of the materials themselves are, in some words, useless. They are full of blatant inaccuracies, such as outdated Laws (and when I brought this up to my tutor, she, at first, dismissed it as she 'couldn't find where I was talking about' with no other concern, so I had to give her a direct reference number, and when she found it, admitted it was wrong and said it was 'already going to be edited in the next editing session', even though the Law had changed 10 years ago.) The materials also are very vague, it cannot be completely understood or even give enough information to even answer the questions which ICS give you themselves, without the accompanying AQA textbook (which, it's worth mentioning I was told to buy the WRONG textbook at first, I had to work out which one to buy myself) I also realised that there is a lot of free websites that provide suspicously similar content, but yet I am paying £300+ to read almost the same thing. The sections are all very short, very brief & there is nothing to it other than reading off a screen. 
I cannot give them the benefit of the doubt here, and say that it might just be 'the way i learn', because I am doing better by myself, using Google, knowledgable people in my real life on the subject & reading the AQA textbook than I am with ICS learn, and I'm getting all that for free!, not £300+. The reason I paid for this service was naively, I thought it would provide more structure to how I should learn the content (it doesn't), my tutor would be able to provide support, advice & encouragement when I did message her (she is instead, blunt & disinterested), and I would be somewhat validated as a student (this is now the only reason I haven't cancelled, as I have paid too much towards the course already, so what a waste) Let this be a warning to anyone considering studying with ICS.",Person,,Marie,https://uk.trustpilot.com/users/5de24b27ae77587028b4502b,Thing,ICS Learn,Organization,Trustpilot,https://uk.trustpilot.com,Rating,1

His professional attitude and apt conversational skills lead me to be intrigued. He built up a solid case for joining ICS as I was previously interested so I did more research and was looking to go with another company.

I have never been so pleased with the ease of the on boarding process for my future as I have with Ciaran. He has brought a joy to my life that even two ply toilet paper could not achieve.

There are platforms that you can contact ICS learn about the course you are doing, but they are not proactive in any way other than advising you of when tutors are on annual leave. 
You are left to your own devices, and there is not encouragement or direct contact to engage with you.
I submitted my first assignments and felt that the feedback from the tutor was incredibly negative. The second assignment submitted to the same tutor had feedback that wasn't in relation to my submission, and again, I felt was negative and demotivating. 
I contacted them to have a different tutor assigned. This seemed to be an issue, however, after pushing with my knowledge of how training companies must be set up, they assigned me a different tutor. 
Unfortunately, by this point I was incredibly demotivated and felt no encouragement or support to continue with my course.
As I said, it may well just have been the wrong course format for me, or may be I hoped for too much, but if you want encouragement and for the training provider to instigate engagement, I couldn't recommend ICS learn.",Person,,JH,https://uk.trustpilot.com/users/58c183cd0000ff000a7fdbad,Thing,ICS Learn,Organization,Trustpilot,https://uk.trustpilot.com,Rating,3

secondly few of the tutors really reply quickly that increase your motivation and allows you to go ahead. they also address your issues and doubts in no time. but it all depends from one tutor to another.

The fact that I was put straight through to her makes it feel like you are valued as a student and gives you some familiarity which makes you feel like they really care about you as an individual.

2527,Review,2019-11-12T13:06:04+00:00,GCSE/A LEVEL BEWARE! LOOK ELSEWHERE!,en,"I have been a member of ICS Learn since 2017 and have undertaken 2 A Levels and 2 GCSEs with them.

It was nothing but frustrating trouble and a waste of money. Please, look elsewhere. You will regret buying these courses.

The courses are rife with spelling and grammatical mistakes - my emails about mistakes in the courses reached into the double digits. I was told they would be fixed - 2 months later and still nothing. 

The tutor(s) you are given aren't the 1-2-1 tutors you'd expect. Think of it more as being in school/college with 30-50 other students. Tutors often take more than a day to reply, usually missing the point of your question completely, leaving you no more confident than before they answered. By the time your tutor has replied, you've moved on from that question. It's clunky and messaging your tutor feels like a burden and a chore.

The majority of courses consistent of long walls of text with no real objective or clear points. A summary is usually given at the end but still isn't clear.

These are just a few points with what's wrong with their A Level and GCSE courses. The majority of the good reviews come from customers leaving reviews after signing up with the super-smooth process or the in-house maths teacher asking you to rate her maths session, as you can see by my only other 2 reviews.

I would recommend any other distance-learning site more than this one. I regret buying these courses and spending upwards of £1000. Absolutely beware - browse the low-scoring reviews to get a more accurate feel of this 'learning provider'.

I'm well aware that the employees of ICS Learn know who I am after countless emails and complaining - never a good thing!",Person,https://user-images.trustpilot.com/5b9189e34de5666d34e6e3b7/73x73.png,Lauren Axford-Rhodes,https://uk.trustpilot.com/users/5b9189e34de5666d34e6e3b7,Thing,ICS Learn,Organization,Trustpilot,https://uk.trustpilot.com,Rating,1

'Checks/tests' during the learning are often too inflexible and tell you you're wrong when in fact you are correct - which is demoralising (e.g. in the accountancy course you are told that commas in amounts are optional but tests will sometimes 'want' (without saying) £1000 at other times £1,000 and mark wrong if you don't 'guess' right), and sometimes they are plain wrong, such as addition errors which confuse students trying to learn. Having part-completed an accountancy level 2 I would strongly advise registering with AAT and buying a book instead! Personally I did an OU course many years ago and cannot praise their learning materials enough. This course feels like it has never been proof-read and I feel like I parted with money for no good reason. The tutor has been quite useful when asked advice, but if the course material were the standard it should be (for the price) the learning would be so much easier.",Person,,Martyn,https://uk.trustpilot.com/users/5c0909a7cf59643c1aac4313,Thing,ICS Learn,Organization,Trustpilot,https://uk.trustpilot.com,Rating,2

ICS don't use plagarism checkers anyway and the tutors have so many essays to mark they dont check either. they get paid either way. I resent paying so much money for complete lack of communication and support. If ICS take action against me, I'll take action of my own. After all, it is false advertising.

I felt the materials provided on the ICS portal were very basic, particularly disappointing were the video seminar recordings which consist of a woman reading through a powerpoint slide show with very little deterioration from the script and indicate the host had little accounting knowledge. If you compare these seminars to the excel one on the AAT site you will realise how engaging seminars can be with the right host. I was also left disappointed by the lack of tutor support, I received two marked test feedbacks during the whole of my course so it felt very much like self-study.

The only positive from the course was the Kaplan books which ICS provided, I was used to them from Level 2 and they provided me with a good understanding of the subject but I was left wandering why ICS were charging so much for what amounts to a self-study course.",Person,,John,https://uk.trustpilot.com/users/5db1fcf683b09ed2c6a36e75,Thing,ICS Learn,Organization,Trustpilot,https://uk.trustpilot.com,Rating,2

The transactions was effortless and I'm actually excited to be learning. I even got an email from my tutor introducing herself on a Sunday.

I found this to be a embarrassing thing to not know so reached out to my tutor and gave hints that i would possibly need help with this and also if i could use the course material after the year so that maybe i can book my exam for 2021 instead. However I was told ""see how you feel closer to the exam"" which didn't help at all as I cant book the exam or even learn the stuff I need to.

However, I spent time researching ICS, the programme and speaking to helpful advisors at ICS before making a decision.  I felt reassured that the programme was flexible and I was able to complete it in my own time.  This flexibility recognises the diversity of lives and jobs that all students of ICS lead, which is why the structure is so valuable.
Support Services were always on hand to answer my questions and provide support and the tutors have all been very encouraging.  I've asked a lot of 'silly questions,' or sought clarity on module questions and their wording, and always received helpful advice.

I looked at many courses and decided on the IGCSE with ICS Learn, the cost did have some bearing on this.  
But I don't regret it, as the course was easy to follow and if you can't make the on line class, they are on the course website and then you can revisit them when you are revising.  You tutor is there if you need them but I had no difficulties working through the course.  You can learn at your own speed.  I found it easy to find a school/college that took external candidates.  I took my exam and later lost all confidence that I would pass, but when results day came I had the biggest shock ever as I got a 7.
Yes I put in a lot of effort but if it wasn't for ICS Learn and the support of my tutor, I wouldn't be writing this review.

When revising for the exams, there were many times that the course material would state 'as I write this in the summer of 2012' or 'now, in 2016'. This was frustrating as it was very stressful revising old data. There is no reason why this is not regularly updated. 

In addition, exam support was 3 weeks before the exam, this should be before as it was a very worrying and stressful time to not have support. I am aware that there had previously been revision weekends where people would meet with a tutor, this should be reconsidered as there are not even an presentations online to at least talk through and outline what is expected to be understood on the exam. It is just a case of, this is the topic, learn it.",Person,,Charlotte Evans,https://uk.trustpilot.com/users/5d5bce51a95ec99d76d41505,Thing,ICS Learn,Organization,Trustpilot,https://uk.trustpilot.com,Rating,3

I enrolled to do the GCSE Maths & English, so Fraser took me through the payment process and explained everything to me. I am paying on payment plan, and Frase gave me the options for date for each monthly payment. 
Fraser then explained, all the information I would receive. And if I had any problems then I can contact him direct.
I am pleased with how I was into enrollingnon any course.

Re: CIPD Level 5 L&D Diploma

Originally signed up back in 2015 and during that time had all kinds of problems with their site and content. It spoilt my learning experience and in the end I gave up.

Several years later planned to go back and complete remaining units with another provider. Only to be told by ICS that the 2 units I had completed, I had not actually completed and they would only credit me with one unit.

Apparently I had missed several actions in the first unit including a case study and CPD upload. Which is not technically possible as the LMS would simply not let you move on to the next unit until you had done the work.

I can only presume their poor IT messed up or the course has changed since. Despite being offered 2 months to complete the extra work, I really don't want anything to do with this company as I spent a lot of money on a poor experience with little to show for it.

I should say the lecturers were always very helpful, but let down by poor courseware and IT.",Person,https://user-images.trustpilot.com/5c460d00e595f66f2bb4c0a8/73x73.png,Paul Bruce,https://uk.trustpilot.com/users/5c460d00e595f66f2bb4c0a8,Thing,ICS Learn,Organization,Trustpilot,https://uk.trustpilot.com,Rating,1
2919,Review,2019-08-14T06:16:09+00:00,Disappointed and concerned,en,"I completed my CIPD Level 3 HR qualification with ICS in March 2019. During the course I found the lectures interesting and the tutors supportive, and overall enjoyed studying with ICS. However, when I passed my course I was advised that it would be referred to the CIPD to go through their internal checks before they would send out my certificate. I was advised this process can take up to 12 weeks. It is now 5 months later and I have not received anything - I’ve chased this with ICS Student Services a few times and been told that my coursework is still with the CIPD and should be confirmed shortly. On my most recent chase (as we are well over 12 weeks at this point) I was told by ICS to pick this up with the CIPD directly. When I contacted the CIPD, they advised they could only get this processed once my coursework had been sent over and provided an email address that it should have been sent to by my course provider. Therefore, it seems that my coursework was not correctly submitted by ICS and had not been re-checked when I had chased them previously for an update. I’ve sent this information across to ICS several days ago and stressed the urgency of my email as official certification is conditional to my most recent job HR job offer and I’ve not received a response. I’ve chased again this morning and asked for urgent resolution as I do not think it’s fair for the course provider to ask me to pick this up with the CIPD to find out what’s going on in light of the circumstance. I was not involved in the process whereby ICS submit my coursework (or in this case not) to CIPD therefore they should liaise between themselves. Hopefully I should get a response and some clarity today, but needless to say this has been very distressing and seems as if ICS haven’t really demonstrated any care to my queries once I’ve paid/completed the course on their side of things.",Person,,Hannah Bright,https://uk.trustpilot.com/users/5b7b1c534de5666d34c64903,Thing,ICS Learn,Organization,Trustpilot,https://uk.trustpilot.com,Rating,2

I have enrolled on 3 courses, I have had limited communication with my tutors and no sign of any assignments coming up in the future either. 

I have come across so many errors and broken links within their outdated course content which has made certain aspects truly impossible to complete. 

The courses themselves are put together in a very boring and 2D fashion, you are promised that you will have clips to view, audios to listen to and other great learning tools, when in reality I have read from a screen, then been told to read the same thing in a book and then write a blog about both the things that I read, a blog which will never be read by anyone or checked. 

So if your learning style is to just read pages and pages then ICS could be for you, but if you are looking for something that will support interactive learning then go elsewhere. 

I have tried to raise a complaint, it took someone almost 2 weeks to respond, I then replied and 2 and a half weeks later have still not heard back. 

Avoid ICS, they have really ruined my learning experience and I am now not sure if I can even carry on.

2988,Review,2019-07-16T13:35:49+00:00,Just ok - This review is about what happens past enrolment,en,"This review is about what happens past enrolment process – the majority of the reviews here are strangely about enrolment (which is very confusing for those wanting a genuine course review. I did a massive amount of research for CIM course providers and I’ve realised that if you study online, they are all pretty much the same. I was also going to just go through a book, so I thought there wasn’t much point going for a more expensive course.

I would that with ICS you get what you pay for. It was by far the cheapest course on the market, AND there was a discount at the time, so I thought that I might as well go for it.

The important thing to note here is that the materials that you use are the same everywhere – you get access to a module guide through your CIM membership and the books that you’re recommended are the same (almost). The only thing that’s different is the guidance on what to do when and also some additional information that doesn’t appear in the book or the module guide, but can be asked on the exam.

I felt that ICS’s platform was ok, however, the way the course is presented is not very appealing. I forced myself to go through it just because I felt I had to. I understand why ICS did it this way as there are interactive activities there as well, but not enough in my opinion to justify the format. The background is horrible grey and the font in the activities is quite small. The materials are not printable, which is a real shame – I would rather they were (some other courses do that). Some considerable amount of materials is presented through presentations – videos on YouTube. Not sure if that’s how ICS tried to save space? They are extremely inconvenient to watch and some don’t even have a voice-over (in the ones that do, the voice is actually distracting from reading), and you have to stop to read the slide all the time. Now I know why some courses advertise themselves as “presentation free”. I thought it was just me, but other fellow students also complained on the forum about all these points.

Despite all this, I really enjoyed going through the course, but when I reached the last unit, I’ve realised that I had a lot more to read through than I expected based on the previous two units – it was like the unit was the size of the whole previous two. I wish ICS have provided some information on the volume of content in each unit as well as a suggested studying schedule as it caused me a lot of stress before the exam.

Also, it says in the instructions that you shouldn’t attempt the test until you’ve studied the whole module. However, I disagree – when you see the questions for the first time after studying the whole thing, it’s a bit of a shock as you realised that you were learning the wrong things for the past 3 months. I wish ICS have provided their own questions (or from past papers) after each half of the unit – this way you will be prepared for the format, strengthen your knowledge and will feel that final tests are just putting it together.

I also felt that the response was a bit slow – I had to chase my tutor and curriculum coordinator 3 times before I got a reply, as a result, never got a call with my tutor at all. Maybe ICS should have a cut-off point (like a month before the exam) for any communications with your tutor if they feel that they can't guarantee a call a week before the exam. I might have been just unlucky and I understand it was a busy period, however, it would be nice to talk to the tutor when he said he was available. But the people at ICS are lovely and polite – I give them that!

So in conclusion, I do not think this course is good value for money. But having said all that, I don’t think that any CIM course from any provider is good value for money, as some courses are more than double of what I’ve paid to ICS (not even including the extortionate CIM exam fees). If I could, I would have taken a CIM course with a private tutor (and will probably pay the same money), but unfortunately, you have to go through a centre. I’m just happy that it was cheap and I hope that ICS improves the points other learners and I have raised for the future students.

If you are wondering whether to go with ICS, do check if any of this has changed!",Person,https://user-images.trustpilot.com/5d2dd2ac9192676dcf51d53c/73x73.png,Sofia Balderson,https://uk.trustpilot.com/users/5d2dd2ac9192676dcf51d53c,Thing,ICS Learn,Organization,Trustpilot,https://uk.trustpilot.com,Rating,3

To help you in your studies and help you proceed. Im not sure if this is how online courses work or its just ISC.

 Paid 6 Months which is a total of £380 and i havent done a single thing or exam. I cancelled my direct debit and told them im going to cancel the course and told them my issues. They said tutor is there to help you and i didnt contact him. also asked for some additional help like to send me text books but they said they dont do that no more.

Now they telling me to pay a £50 cancellation fee which i was ok to pay but then they said i have to pay this month which is another £63, i wanted to cancel last month which i was told someone will be in contact with me and no one did till this month has started. I was Also told to pay off the aat membership fee which is another £100 or more.

I was also told if i did not pay they will hand it over to a debt collector. It seems they only care about their money and nothing else. 

As long as you pay, they dont care about you. Even if you do the course or not, even if you are financillay unstable. similar situtation have happened if you look at other reviews.

update:
I have already been contacted and have said my concerns but all they seem to worry about is the money that allegedly I owe. I am ok to pay off the cancellation fee of £50 but I dont feel as if I need to pay off another months worth when I clearly stated last month I want to cancel and was still awaiting a call, which then led to this month. also the remaining aat membership fee which is not stated in the Enrolment document I have signed that I need to pay off the remaining fee.",Person,,Abdul Mubin,https://uk.trustpilot.com/users/5d27571679b4f56d2d0e26a4,Thing,ICS Learn,Organization,Trustpilot,https://uk.trustpilot.com,Rating,1

I looked at the reviews on this site and thought I was making a good decision but now I realise after reading back through them they all talk about how nice the sales team are and not about the actual course itself. You have a limited time to get through this course and the indicated time that ICS say that it takes to complete each section is misleadingly low (by a large margin). You only find this out when you are doing the course where you then are alerted to the time extension at the end for more cost.  The site itself takes a long time to navigate and the actual written literature is insufficient.  ICS learn require you to use Harvard referencing but inadequately reference their sources so that it is almost impossible to find them yourself resulting in a huge amount of time to produce a very limited amount of work.  In actuality it is better to forget their entire literature and simply 'google'.  When speaking to ICS about the stress of failure (my company has paid for this course and if I fail I need to pay back the whole lump sum rather than the amount paid out so far if I was paying monthly), their answer was that it wasn't refundable in any way.  I am a working parent who was attracted to this course on its promise of flexibility to fit around my busy schedule.  Now to complete it I have to pay for additional childcare and may as well have done this course at a local university where I could talk to my tutors as and when I needed. I would also recommend to those who are starting on their HR career to look elsewhere. A lot of the answers require you to relate back to your own practice and you may not have experienced these situations during your career thus far leaving you scrabbling around to think of an answer to worse still pretending.
To conclude, I strongly recommend you try elsewhere.",Person,,Louise,https://uk.trustpilot.com/users/5cf926fda04a8d5be401e4f1,Thing,ICS Learn,Organization,Trustpilot,https://uk.trustpilot.com,Rating,2

Your review

I honestly can't thank ICS team enough for their immense support and well-designed study materials to enhance student learning. I'm a mature student who returned to study GCSE that I didn't do well in back in high school. For many years I've been avoiding it, even when I started the course with ICS I was very apprehensive about it because I lacked confidence. Studying with ICS honestly gave me that confidence and push I needed to achieve my desired grades. I'm left feeling like I can do anything now. I've just completed one course with ICS this year and now signed up to do 2 more!....

Scrolling through the great many of the positive reviews relate to the on-boarding process for ICS, not the actual courses. Those reviews that relate to the course itself are mixed - with some extremely negative reviews.

When I phoned ICS Learn to question this, the gentlemen I was connected to 'Fraser' was extremely defensive and rather than answering my questions about the negative reviews (teachers taking up to two weeks to respond, the site being difficult to navigate, there being spelling mistakes) - he told me that i was nit-picking, deliberately finding negative reviews and that if I should question whether I want to study an A-Level with them at all. I said that trying to ascertain whether the course would be good and if the negative reviews had validity was perfectly normal behaviour for a consumer. What is not normal is a firm dismissing this.

I said I was not nit-picking, that i had read a great many reviews but the positive ones predominantly pertained to the onboarding process.

In all my life, of being a consumer, I have never had my interest in the purchase questioned when I am raising legitimate queries.

I asked to speak to Fraser's manager, Michelle, who said she would not listen to the call at all or if she did it was for Fraser's benefit only. 

This firm seems extremely suspicious and I am dumbfounded that they think it is acceptable to treat anyone this way. Consumers must question before purchasing anything in life.

I have found the site is so difficult to navigate despite their poor attempts of 'induction videos'. I emailed student services as I found the site problems I was having and the lack of communication from tutors dramatically slowing my learning down and leaving me frustrated and wanting to quit. Student services told me to contact my tutor and my tutor told me to contact student services.

I was only advised 3 months after starting how to book onto an online classroom.

I am constantly stressed when I log on, nothing to do with the actual course, but the site is ridiculous. I am computer illiterate and work on computers for my current position so have no problem there. I have now asked for help from my brother who is a web developer who also told me how he finds the site irritating and not user friendly at all.

I wish I had not paid out the extra money to do an online course and just took day release with work to do a physical classroom taught class. 

Still to this day I struggle and get no help. I have given up trying to find the 'free ebooks' and now just use my friends university library pass to get what I need from there. Paying £2800 and having to pay for books is unrealistic as the suggested reading books are £50 each minimum.

I am a current student who would not recommend this site unfortunately it just leaves me with unnecessary stress and anxiety (which student services are aware of but have still made no efforts to support).",Person,,Anonymous,https://uk.trustpilot.com/users/5ccf24746e5fb2276f7f6c64,Thing,ICS Learn,Organization,Trustpilot,https://uk.trustpilot.com,Rating,1

I will begin with saying that the online videos and text were very easy to follow along with and clearly laid out. The staff I spoke to over the phone were extremely helpful.

However, I can only give 2 stars for this course for a number of reasons as listed below:
Firstly, I found them very simplified and in some cases, missed out parts of important information that I know from my previous studies should have been included in the videos/text.
Secondly, upon being assigned a tutor, I found his replies very slow and unnecessarily rude and blunt. He was extremely unclear about what exactly he wanted me to do in the examination videos (e.g.- he did not clarify that he wanted me to spot someone in an exercise that doesn't always require a spotter), meaning I had to refilm the videos 3 times. The videos could have been completed first time round if he would have given me clear instructions.

Additionally, the first time I submitted a video for assessment, he took over 2 weeks to give feedback (which was actually the same for every video), and upon giving me my results, he forgot to attach the feedback sheet so I sent an email asking where it was and I was left for an additional 2 days until he responded saying he 'had jet lag' so forgot to add it!

Next, the videos were extremely difficult to upload onto the online system. They were slow and the whole layout was very scattered and long winded that it was difficult to properly determine if I'd uploaded the correct video into the correct section.

Overall, just not very pleased with this course. I wish I'd gone with someone else or just done a full-time 2 week course instead",Person,,Victoria,https://uk.trustpilot.com/users/5bf0290a5483f4b8a9973054,Thing,ICS Learn,Organization,Trustpilot,https://uk.trustpilot.com,Rating,2

This is my 4th degree (I have 2 Bachelor's and 1 MBA), and the 2nd one done fully online. As a specialist in digital learning technologies, I have to say that the quality of this e-learning programme is of extremely poor quality. The tutor support is minimal - in the webinars, the tutor who seems to have a speaking dysfunction talks about how to complete the assessments, there is no teaching or facilitation of any manner. The programme is very basic and based on the student's reading the articles, links to which are provided in abundance, and writing papers at the end of each unit. There is no interactivity or learner engagement, just literally a page-turning exercise from beginning to end. As an e-learning professional, I find it unbelievable that the course on L&D is completely oblivious to the principles of effective computer-based learning. The content is more HR-related and there is nothing about what I really need to learn - how the memory works, adult learning methodologies, Ruth Clark's principles, Bloom's cognitive taxonomy, brain-friendly learning, Gagne's evens of instruction, etc. I'm hugely disappointed, to say the least!",Person,,Tina Rudd,https://uk.trustpilot.com/users/5c8793c5c142949a77a0bf54,Thing,ICS Learn,Organization,Trustpilot,https://uk.trustpilot.com,Rating,1

3424,Review,2019-01-29T18:37:57+00:00,Biggest mistake I ever made,en,"I enrolled with ICS in December 2018 for a level 5 CIPD diploma for HRM. I chose ICS as they are a well known name. However, it has turned out to be the biggest mistake I ever made...
I was told I could pay the minimum deposit amount upfront (this minimum deposit amount was never confirmed in any email correspondence, only the figure £100 was used in a hypothetical repayment example) or I was told I could choose to pay any amount I wanted so I chose to pay £1000 upfront to take a chunk off of the monthly payments. 
Since I enrolled my marriage has irretrievably broken down and I am now in a situation where I am living alone and about to go through a divorce. 
Due to this change in circumstances I am no longer able to complete the course for both personal and financial reasons.
I have not used any of the course materials or support and have not completed any of the coursework. I haven’t even started the course at all.
I contacted ICS student services to explain my situation and was told that because all course materials and support access had been made available to me I would not get any of my £1000 back and in addition I would be charged a cancellation fee of 10% of the remaining balance for the course + £50. 
I understand that there is a cancellation fee if the course is cancelled after the 14 day cooling off period and I have no issue with paying this and would have expected the minimum deposit amount to be deducted from my £1000 and the reminder refunded.
If this had been the case and for example I had paid £100 deposit I would only be losing £365.50 as opposed to £1265.50. My argument is that whether I had paid the minimum deposit at the start or paid the £1000, all of the course materials etc. would still have been made available to me. So what exactly am I paying £1000 for? 
This situation is completely unacceptable and is very distressing to me from both a personal and financial point of view given the difficult situation I am going through at the moment. 
I trusted ICS as a reputable company but they are just out to get people’s money.
I will be advising everyone I know to stay away from them and not take the risk of handing over their money. 
ICS have no empathy for personal circumstances, no regard for their customers and clearly no interest in being recommended to others. 
I am utterly disgusted.",Person,,Customer,https://uk.trustpilot.com/users/590362d80000ff000a92421c,Thing,ICS Learn,Organization,Trustpilot,https://uk.trustpilot.com,Rating,1

She is the maths teacher for the course and not only her live/recorded lessons clear, well taught and easy to understand, she will always reply to any questions or queries via email and will go out of her way to send extra materials. I honestly believe she is one of the best. 

The course itself is well spread out, however the only negative thing i will say is that i do believe the dashboard/homepage for the website could be better (ie. less confusing).

3565,Review,2018-11-21T15:23:24+00:00,Stressful customer service that has no consistency and wastes time...,en,"Very poor system that they have in place and very slow to deal with problems. No urgency, and if a problem occurs they don’t really care that your stuck for time and takes longer than necessary. 

The material is ok. Not the greatest. Some of the tutors use poor recording equipment when recording seminars. Have to really concentrate on what they are saying. The videos themselves can be slow loading, (note my broadband download speed is 33mbps)  I spent most of the time searching on YouTube or google for better explanations. Especially when it came to the anatomy. 

Now for the exam process. You have to call up and book your exam. Paying for it over the phone. This to me is a very old system that can be streamlined. This is limiting you to a certain time period when you can call up. And also if you’re overseas. Unable to pay for your exam. You then have to wait for a “code” to be sent to your email. 
   This entire system as I’ve experinced is floored with human error (got sent code to wrong exam).  I then was sent a code that did not work. And had to wait for next day to inform student service just to be told to wait even longer...

If you don’t mind being messed around a little, and have your time wasted multiple times. Then go for it. But this isn’t a “learning Centre” I’d recommend to my worst enemy.",Person,,P.P,https://uk.trustpilot.com/users/5bf578625483f4b8a97c6fad,Thing,ICS Learn,Organization,Trustpilot,https://uk.trustpilot.com,Rating,3

Some of the tutors, Julie and Keith especially are honestly fantastic. I was lucky enough to be on an older version of the course and meet them both in a class workshop. They are honestly so great, so kind, so funny and really inspiring people. Going on the workshop really helped me but I know that isn't an option on the new courses but I would definitely recommend calling your tutor and getting to know them. They really know their stuff and you can learn so much from them. Julie honestly is an asset to this company - she really is truly fantastic and been the best teacher/tutor I've ever had. Keith is a top lad. 

The customer service team are sooo unbelievably lovely and so helpful. I've felt so stressed this whole time but every time I've ever spoken to them, they've been completely nonjudgmental, so helpful, so nice and also have had a bit of a laugh with some of them which has massively helped me calm down and feel like I can actually do this.

Level 3 is pretty easy and if you're nervous and haven't written an essay in a long time - would definitely 100% recommend do not go higher than level 3! 

I think if ICS can think of ways to bring the community together this would be extremely beneficial. I met people on my workshops and we now have an CIPD group chat and we all have helped each other to finish.

Really met some really wonderful, lovely, great people on this course. I'm so thankful and grateful to ICS.

I found the course site quite hard to navigate, I didn't find that there was much guidance on how best to approach the course either. I had a really bad experience with one tutor who I found rude and condescending and was asking for conflicting information to what was required by CIPD resulting in me receiving 2 X NYP for a piece of work in which I had correctly answered the question the first time around. I was finally switched to another tutor after querying this and an investigation finding that he was asking for different information to what was conveyed in the online classroom. 

I also found that on many of the assignments, the question that they asked was very different to the information that they actually required for you to pass the module. This wastes a lot of time and meant having to call the tutors to ask what they actually needed you to answer. On speaking to the tutors they were also aware that the questions were misleading and not very clear. 

I found a lot of the course material to be outdated and little consistency across modules/tutors on the support that they provided on passing the assignments.

Overall I am unlikely to use ICS again as I found this whole process very stressful and more time consuming than it should have been.",Person,,Mia,https://uk.trustpilot.com/users/5bcefff04de5666d34543b9b,Thing,ICS Learn,Organization,Trustpilot,https://uk.trustpilot.com,Rating,3

The tutors were kind and helpful and were very good with their feedback.

Stephen and David were ace great feedback very good interaction and helpful advice.

I spoke with Anne-Marie numerous times over the last week and the service she provided couldn't have been better! She explained every process step by step, included some tips of her own with regard to the studies and generally made the sign up process very smooth. All emails were responded to promptly and answered in depth. There was no ""sales-pitch"" or pushiness that I experienced with other providers, just the facts. My only negative of the process has nothing to do with the service; the opening times of the office are a little unrealistic for people who work full time. 8:30-4:30 was a struggle for me personally, but we made it in the end.

I had no academic qualification and it was not until the age 22 that I started learning a language properly - English. However, in the college I was learning, after finishing ESOL Level 2 course, I was told that my English level does not meet the criteria to get GCSE qualification. 

I decided to learn by my self through ICS Learn for English and Math GCSEs. Their courses gives good firm grasp of the subject they are teaching and it is designed in such a way that even someone completely new will be able to understand. And now I am very happy to say that I got A in English and B in Math.

Returning back to studying can be extremely daunting but they make the journey very easy, talking you through the process and providing so much online support you would think you were in the class - which is great.

However, I have to say the student support online is second to none - they have always responded quickly to my requests, they navigate you in the right direction and they keep you on track.

For anyone who has not studied for many years (over 20 for me) and want to, but don't have the confidence to get back out there, please speak to ICS and just go for it!! You'll never regret it, you will kick yourself for not doing it.
I decided to self-finance my CIPS training, I decided this was the best option for me, a little scary but so glad I am doing this. I have received excellent customer service so far and this is just in the initial joining stage, this is a great sign of things to come!!
All happens so quickly and easily. I was looking on-line one evening, saw the ICS Learn brand; which was familiar to me, downloaded some information and put in request for a call back. The very next morning I received a call from Nicola, who talked me through the process and explained more about the ICS Lean brand, their background along with their impressive success rate. Nicola was very knowledgeable, answered all my questions, filled me with confidence; I felt that I was making the right decision to self-finance the course, and do this with the support of ICS.
After talking to Nicola, within minutes I received an email from her listing out the course, financials and the service ICS offered. I was sold!!
The process of enrolment is quick and easy, within minutes I received my welcome email, my enrolment details, student number (eek I'm a student again), I also received a welcome email from my tutor giving me some early study tips.
Honestly I am so pleased I have done this and I couldn't recommend ICS Learn highly enough, I wish there were more than 5 stars available.

Please consider this route for home study, especially anyone of a ""certain age"" who may think going back to education isn't something they have the confidence to do. You have nothing to lose and everything to gain.

Thank you Nicola for all your help with getting me on-board with my course.

I have canceled my CIPD membership and started a new career. If this is the present of L&D, I don't want to be part of it. In my opinion, L&D should be taught and experienced differently, on a more modern, dynamically and engaging manner.

My experience: It was a very old school one-way training, with no interaction. There is a forum where you can post your work, but nobody gives you feedback. There is just a long list of papers. there is no encouragement to give feedback. There is one webinar you must attend to be able to submit your assignment for each section.
The references suggested to complete the assignments are outdated. I didn't experience a real learning or development, I felt like you just do the stuff to get the certificate.
The portal is not intuitive and complicated to use. Is difficult to find what you look for.
Summary of my experience: I felt it was boring and non-engaging. Definitely not for millennials.
Also, I didn't feel nobody cares if I finished or not the course.

Positives: some of the teachers were really good and supportive.

The course booklets were longwinded to give the impression of value for money they most definitely are not, they are time consuming and unnecessary , I found the same information in the GCSE  and A Level subjects book I bought in only a small chapter. You can find past exam papers for all boards all subjects online for free as well as the marking criteria to check your progress. I got a grade A in my subject by using past papers online and saving my time and using only a course book for my subject and revision guide bought for only £10. If there is a local college or a tutor near you use the money on them If you want guidance in your studies.

If you really want to try ics learn use the 14 day guarantee not sure if you will be charged to cancel please check some people on here have said there is an additional £50 cancellation fee which is unfair and not good customer care as they would be charging You money to leave them! You could download all the booklets see if they are of use to you as that is all you are paying for with them. Please do check the cancellation fee before giving your card details.

Ultimately I don't recommend ics learn at all you can do this without them in my experience for GCSE and A level basically anything that has no coursework, please read the other 1 and 2 star ratings on here from people having taken subjects with Coursework to see their experiences.

Ics learn must make millions every year this online learning is very lucrative for them, unfortunately  their service does not reflect what they say they will offer. The five star reviews are truly baffling for this company it may be the first time many people have enrolled on an online course and are pleased with the initial warm welcome from the SALE  ics have made so of course the company will be very friendly. I expect this review will soon be buried under the five stars from new customers asked to give reviews straight after they have enrolled to keep the ratings unfairly high or students offered £30 vouchers to review the company..... potential students please proceed with caution.

3864,Review,2018-08-10T12:06:13+00:00,"Hidden fees, no interest in whether students pass exams, fake reviews.",en,"1. These reviews are about the sales call, not the courses.  They're deliberately gaming review sites by sending the links and asking for reviews after the initial sales call - so all you're reading are reviews of how friendly sales staff are on the phone.  Of course they're friendly: they're trying to take your money. 

2. HIDDEN FEES.  I've been comparing a few institutions and they specify whether there is an additional cost for marking coursework, and what that fee is.  ICS don't publish the cost for coursework so I had to call them to ask and found out that there is a charge, and it's much  HIGHER than anywhere else charges (for the same qual and same examining board) by a hefty amount.   Interesting that they not only charge a lot more than anyone else, but they also don't tell you how much they're charging unless you know to ask. 

3. I asked for the pass rates for my course and was told this was 'confidential to each student'. I wrote back and explained that an institution's pass rates are not individual private data - I'm asking what percentage of students pass their exams in a particular subject.   They told me they don't monitor this information and pointed me instead at these fake reviews of the college which are actually just reviews of initial sales calls.  
A college that isn't interested in how many students pass their exams?  Students aren't doing GCSEs, A' Levels, CIPDs etc for funsies - surely the pass rate is the *only* performance metric of interest to me, but also to them, how are they monitoring their own performance? Oh, yes, they're only interested in how friendly their sales people are.  Seems like they're not interested in whether students actually pass exams or not. I'll be using Oxford Open College instead - same qualification but less focus on the sales and more focus on answering questions honestly.",Person,,Reba,https://uk.trustpilot.com/users/5b06b45d4de5666d34d425ac,Thing,ICS Learn,Organization,Trustpilot,https://uk.trustpilot.com,Rating,1

The support you get for the cost of the course is disproportionate. But the worst thing is the process once you have finished the course.

After a catalogue of errors by ICS, 6 months later, my results have supposedly only just been sent to to be verified so looking at 8+ months in total from the date I finished.

3931,Review,2018-07-05T11:13:36+00:00,My experience with ICS Learn is frustrating,en,"My experience with ICS Learn is absolutely frustrating and if there was less than a star rating, I would give it. In September, 2017, I joined level 5 CIPD diploma for HRM, that decision was based on the good feedback I read about the centre which turned to be a lie and the worst mistake I ever did. The one who handled my registration, Michelle Kerr, was friendly and I thought that would be a good start to pursue my career in HR. However, when I started using the course website, I was totally lost and confused. it was unclear with poor structure and insufficient information to help me make a start. At the first few months, I experienced double payments so, they were withdrawing the course fees twice a month instead of once a month which negatively impacted other payments. I was so stressed every month because of this mistake and had to send so many mails asking to fix it. When I started studying the course, I was trying to communicate with other students, who I found more supportive than tutors or website. Anyways, contacted my tutor to ask for his advice to make an easy start of my course. He advised to start writing my formative and if I passed it, I can attend whether online or recorded classroom then I can write my summative for unit 1. He said if you passed your formative, you most probably will pass your summative. I wrote my formative for unit 1, and submitted it and received my feedback after 30 minutes that I passed it!!
It felt so good and was motivated to do my summative. After attending a recorded class, I understood the structure required and was so confident on what I should do. it took me 10 days of hard work, reading and writing to follow the required structure and finish my summative. I submitted my summative assignment and waited for a whole week with no feedback. I contacted my tutor, Stephen Litter to check if I would hear back soon. I was surprised few hours later after my messaging him with his feedback that I didn't pass because I didn't provide the right structure!!!
The feedback was totally irrelevant and it seemed like he was rushing or didn't have time to read through. The tutor suggested a totally different structure away from the one discussed in the classroom. For example, he said that the SWOT analysis should be in the appendices however in the classroom they said it should be in your assignment body. It was apparent that the tutor didn't take time to have a look at my assignment. For example, he said you references should be in alphabetical order and it was, he said your CPD and PDP should be as appendix although I put it as appendix. The feedback was Vague and non sense, it didn't even provide clear guidance. I achieved distinction in my pharmaceutical sciences degree, and distinction in my MBA degree from BCU and now I'm in my PhD preparation. I never failed a module and I'm confident enough of my academic capabilities and my work quality. 
You can imagine my frustration to see such an unprofessional feedback that ruined my day and my future plans. I REGRET taking the decision of joining the centre and the course and it was such a waste of time and money. Even when I called to complain and ask about the process of quitting the course, it seemed like they only care about paying the cancellation fees and 10% of the remainder. Is this the way you tackle your customers' complaints? Should this represent a respected body such as CIPD? Is this the kind of service you provide? Is this the quality of education you offer? 
Im totally disappointed and frustrated in the way you deliver your service or handling complaints. I paid the money to quit the course just to get rid of this improper, unprofessional, poorly structured, demotivating and disappointing course and centre. 
I will make sure I spread the word among all my family, friends, organizations and every respectful website to help people avoid the frustration I'm experiencing now. I will be more than glad to help people distinguish between good service and poor service.",Person,,Amal Ragab,https://uk.trustpilot.com/users/5b3dfd5d4de5666d342811e3,Thing,ICS Learn,Organization,Trustpilot,https://uk.trustpilot.com,Rating,1

The content of the course was very interesting. Sometimes however, the modules were lengthy and it got quite difficult to retain the information being learnt. I wonder if the sessions could be more interactive with an interactive quiz at the end of each module to complete to confirm learning.
With the summative assignment, it was not very noticeable that you needed to read a case summary to complete the assignment. I actually completed the assignment before realising that a case summary was available so had to restart which was frustrating, but I recognise this was my fault. Could it be more obvious that the case summary needs to be read i.e. putting a line in, in the summative assignment and link to read the case summary?

Before starting the review, I should advise that the course was substantially cheaper than it's competitors and as the certificate is issued by the CIPD there is no difference in the value of the certification.

Point 1: I had issues with the setting up of a direct debit at the start of the course. This resulted in a payment being taken twice in one month - not really acceptable.

Point 2: I have received support from student services in the last month or so. Louise has been particularly helpful. The service in this respect was very good.

Point 3: Some of the modules were very well written (Employment Law and Reward Management come to mind). Others were not so well written, and made the learning experience really frustrating

Point 4: The online classrooms are infrequent and at very awkward times. Recordings of previous classrooms are supplied - which I had no choice but to use as an alternative in most modules. ICS really, really, really need to invest in quality microphones for their tutors. Some of the classrooms were really difficult to make out what the tutors were saying.

So all-in-all I would say that the comparative value compared to competitors is very good, but there is lots of room for improvement.",Person,,Chris,https://uk.trustpilot.com/users/577b73720000ff000a2ef25d,Thing,ICS Learn,Organization,Trustpilot,https://uk.trustpilot.com,Rating,4

Many times I have been quoted prices, exemptions etc and they change.  I have overpaid for my AAT membership this way and incurred bank charges after contract cancellation due to poor internal communication.  An example - I was offered 2 months extra time to finish as I told them I was leaving (as in they won't get my money anymore).  However, months before with copies of all my certificates from Doctor I had to beg for an extension and pay a fee to Doctor for certs and only got 3 months.  6 months is the maximum.  PTSD and I couldn't get a 6 month extension with proof to help me finish my studies.  Say I am cancelling and what is my last fee - oh you can have 2 free months.

Working full time meant I had not made as much progress as I thought I had still plenty of time to complete the course. The only option to extend was an addition £60 per month to enable me to complete the course which is about 50% of the monthly course fee! The same time I also discovered I was pregnant and discussed my options about reducing payments and extending the payment term as I did not wish to give up the course despite now starting a family. ICS did not support the change in circumstances at all and refused to extend the payment term, extend the period of access to the course, nor reduce monthly payments. As a result of this I had no choice but to withdraw from the course as I cannot make monthly payments on maternity pay, I cannot complete the course in the short few weeks left (any work etc wouldn’t get marked), and to top it off I was then asked to pay a cancellation fee. £2k of course fees spent on nothing - all work I had done to date is lost and even if I had completed it I wouldn’t get the qualification until the end of the 22 month payment period, despite only having 15 months access to course content.",Person,,Nicole Dean,https://uk.trustpilot.com/users/5aeb36ea4de5666d34a016f6,Thing,ICS Learn,Organization,Trustpilot,https://uk.trustpilot.com,Rating,1

Can study at your own pace
The fully online course doesn't require travelling

Cons: 
Waiting time to get Assignments marked is horrendous and can impact study period support,
The waiting time between finishing the course and getting the qualification is actually a joke. A lot of money has been paid yet us students are waiting.
PebblePad app thats used for Video assignments has major flaws

4072,Review,2018-04-04T15:50:42+00:00,ICS Learn,en,"UPDATE: (10/04/2018)
I've been in touch with student services to discuss my issues and all has been tied up. My assignment was resubmitted and marked the following day, and support has been given in terms of time management. I have now gladly changed my rating from 2 stars to 3, as I still think that there is a way to go with the website and resources. Sharon Smith (Head of Student Services) has been wonderful in helping me get back on track with my course.

The initial sign up was fantastic, very quick and easy and the chap on the phone knew what he was talking about. Since then, it's been down hill. I asked for support (i.e. helpful guides/time management assistance) as I've been struggling with finding time since a restructure at work (now a higher workload, plus coursework), but the response was really unhelpful, simply telling me the price list for extending the course deadline. I've also been waiting 8 months to have an assignment marked, and customer services are (again) very unhelpful, telling me it isn't there, when it definitely is. Tutors are quick to respond to questions, but I don't feel confident enough in ICS to continue my studies once I've finished this course. I will be looking for an alternative provider for the next level. I completely agree with other reviews stating that ICS only care about their income. The student community has changed a few times recently and none of them in a helpful way. I've been on the course since April 2017 and it still makes no sense to me. It's very poorly laid out and the resources may as well not be there.

She has introduced the maths topics in an easily understandable way, explaining things clearly, providing a great introduction to each topic area as we have gone though lessons. 

I'm working on Unit 3 at the moment and it has occurred to me that I wouldn't consider doing another GCSE or A-Level online course without the aid of video tutorials as Melissa's lessons have really improved the learning experience for me. I say that, as I have recently completed both Geography and History IGCSE and the difference between those and the maths has been considerable. 

I was hoping to do A-Level Maths with ICS Learn in the future but I wont consider doing it until they deliver the content in a similar way as Melissa does. 

More of the same please!

Twice I had organised with my advisor a telephone call to enrol and both times I've waited for the call with no joy. I'm hardly surprised the second call didn't materialise as my advisor emailed me in error, thinking he'd emailed his colleague. He proceeded to ask him if he could ""call this one"", regarding me and my scheduled enrolment call. Hence, the colleague never got the instruction to call me. I also didn't really appreciate being referred to as ""this one"". I hadn't complained over the first missed appointment, as I know problems arise, but now two missed appointments and I'm disheartened.

Sadly, after these further oversights I don't have the confidence with ICS to trust them as course providers. If they show this little management at this stage in the enrolment process, I'm left wondering how much support I would have got once I had started my studies.

Perhaps I had a lucky escape before I had parted with any money. I've given 3 stars as I had been given some useful information and literature regarding the course and I cannot comment on the actual course structure and teaching.",Person,,Lucy ,https://uk.trustpilot.com/users/554e08790000ff0001bdd3c8,Thing,ICS Learn,Organization,Trustpilot,https://uk.trustpilot.com,Rating,3

The tutors have 3-5 WORKING days to response to emails which basically means a week. This doesn't help when you have an exam that week and need a quick turnaround. 
After a pretty bad start, with a tutor that was no help, I contacted one of the higher up Management (Catherine) and fair play, after a lengthy phone call or two, I was given a new tutor, and she listened to me rant and to be fair that was a bonus after what I had experienced. My new tutor is ok and is a lot faster at responding to emails and makes more sense when she does reply, however I think I have just lost faith in the company after the initial start and have also enquired about cancelling my tuition, (as I rarely use the website as I get more information and clearer pictures from Youtube and fellow students on Facebook) but of course they want to charge me for that.

The lessons have good explanations and ease into topics at a pace which suits me. I also watch Melissa's recorded webinars and enjoy them very much. Melissa has a warm and relatable teaching style which makes the course enjoyable and the material easy to understand.

Some minor points for improvement; I would suggest upgrading the interface, just making it a little more user-friendly, with clear icons for the different features. I know that other providers require test papers to be sent by post, so I appreciate the option to upload them online. However, the process of uploading each file took a little too long.

4373,Review,2017-12-07T17:16:44+00:00,A Very Good Experience with a Couple of Very Small Issues.,en,"When comparing the providers that offer CIPD - ICS had a special deal on the CIPD course, as I was paying for this myself this was a big decision in helping me decide, the sign up process was easy and hassle free and then the work could begin, 
I had access to the old student community but I believe it has been significantly updated, it was easy to navigate and it was easy to access all the coursework and textbooks, there are one or two small issues that I have to mention, 1st - the classes run once a week or once a fortnight or once a month, this can be inconvenient if you haven't looked before starting a unit, on hindsight I would definitely recommend looking at the next 3 units ahead to see when the classes are so you can plan your schedule accordingly. 
Also one other issue I found was there was a few technical problems with the online classrooms, where they are cancelled at very short notice, this did happen to me a few times and while understandable can be frustrating, the actual classrooms themselves are extremely helpful and very much worth attending, but sometimes the times are very inconvenient so you need to be aware of this as well, for example the class on the fortnightly schedule will be at 12.30, which isn't practical for everyone or one is at 10am and one at 11am so I had to take half a day off work for them.
One final thing worth mentioning which I don't believe is mentioned on the course prospectus is that some of the later unit's require you to enlist volunteers and record video sessions, I did struggle to enlist volunteers so I'd make sure that you are able to do this, but as a last resort you can do a webex session (which I luckily didn't have to do)
 All of the lecturers are really nice and very helpful and offer plenty of encouragement and good feedback so no complaints there and ICS allow payment by direct debit monthly which is also very helpful.

All in all it was a very good experience and I do recommend ICS but there are just a few small things that prevent me from giving 5 stars. If I could 4.5 out of 5 I would.",Person,,Jamie Smith,https://uk.trustpilot.com/users/519095df00006400013b68d8,Thing,ICS Learn,Organization,Trustpilot,https://uk.trustpilot.com,Rating,4

She was reliable, professional, friendly and so helpful. One of the reasons I had chosen ICSLearn was also because how they made everything so easy for you. I felt like they really did wanna help me from the first email we’ve spoken. Everything went smoothly which I’m really satisfied with the service and staff. 

The price range is also reasonable. I can’t complain anything about this. 

I’ve talked and enquired with a lot of other online providers, I can confirm that ICSLearn is a great online learning provider. 

The payment set-up plan was easy, non-complicated. I have just started my course last month. So far, so good. I like that you can print out the course in papers. Student community isn’t so active between and amongst students - but that’s just quite common in online study. My tutor Anna is a great teacher. I received her reply within 3-4 days, which is fast. Learning materials are updated and great to follow. What I like the most is that there’s a self-check and assignments to do after each topic. And plus I can access my course from my smartphone as well. A huge asset as I don’t always feel like sitting in front of my PC all the time :) I enjoy my course. 

Too bad they don’t offer IAL in science subjects for Edexcel board. Otherwise, I’d have definitely enrolled for more courses with them too!

Recommend to anyone who’s looking to do their IGCSE or any other courses with them. Staff is so helpful, they don’t let you feel ‘alone’. 

THANK YOU MAGGIE.

I’ll update again after my Summer exams how it goes.",Person,,Kayw,https://uk.trustpilot.com/users/5a285cfd0000ff000aed4573,Thing,ICS Learn,Organization,Trustpilot,https://uk.trustpilot.com,Rating,5

Through discussions with other providers, I felt really pressed into joining the course by a certain date and making payment ASAP when this was not possible for business purposes, but Dafina always provided flexibility and understanding.

I am really looking forward to starting my course shortly.",Person,,Kayleigh Wiechers,https://uk.trustpilot.com/users/5a1bfae50000ff000ae82684,Thing,ICS Learn,Organization,Trustpilot,https://uk.trustpilot.com,Rating,5

It's good that you can work at your own pace and it's largely self-directed, but the downside is that no-one checks in with you as to how you're progressing, and how much time you have left to complete the course.

You can start your course at any time you'd like, which is great for flexibility, but I've previously studied with other providers who assign you to a group which creates a sense of community. ICS do have student rooms, but they're rarely used and so it can feel a bit isolating at times.

A lot of the content in the ICS study guides is outdated (some case studies over 13 years old and that's not helpful for using as evidence in exams in 2018, and there's not a lot of new approaches and thinking eg I'd love to see some content on evidence-based practice and the decline of viewing correlation as equalling causation). Some of the study guides read as though they were written a number of years ago, and are just re-churned out each year, which is disappointing given the price of the course.

Both student services and tutors are very helpful and responsive, and assignment feedback is given in a timely manner.",Person,,Chloe Ward,https://uk.trustpilot.com/users/5a1052c20000ff000ae42d35,Thing,ICS Learn,Organization,Trustpilot,https://uk.trustpilot.com,Rating,3

Unfortunately I realised 21 days after signing up that it was going to be too diffcult for me to study while working full time and looking after my daughter as I am a single parent. 
I had already paid a £65 deposit. I called the company and asked them if I could cancel and hopefully try again with them next year to complete the course. 
I explained my situation to the lady and asked if I could possibly get some refund of my deposit. To my dismay she said ""No, you will actually be charged an EXTRA £50 CANCELLATION FEE!!!"" 

I explained to her that I had not accessed any materials or taken any of the tutors time. She was not sympathetic at all to my situation and really did not care that I had told her I was hoping to come back to the same company next year. Even when i told her that I would never think of coming back to the company to do my course she said ""ok thats fine"" like she really didnt care.

Their website is well designed and easy to use, however once you enrol as a student, the student site is not as pretty or as well functioning. There are sometimes bits missing/spelling mistakes. Despite that it is still practical and ideal for its use in studying. 

Their customer service is brilliant, whenever I have had to contact them they have been really helpful. Patient and helpful staff.

The price for the course is great value and you can overlook the cosmetics of the student site with their pricing. I even received 10% off as a returning student. The monthly interest free payment help too.

I did CSE's at school, and always had a fear of numbers. However, I have done several courses since my late thirties including, NVQ L3 and 4 in childcare, GCSE English and Science, Foundation Degree in Childhood Studies and a BA (Hons) Top up. 
Both of my degrees were also online through my local university using Moodle. 
The reason I chose this route for this maths course is because it fits in with my family and work commitments. I also believe that as we get older we learn because we want to and therefore, it is great to find other options for those of us with busy lives! There was no pressure to contribute to the lesson if you did not feel confident to do so, but the tutor Melissa Lieberman made me feel at ease, she is also at the other end of an email or the telephone to offer her students support, which when you decide to finally face your fear of maths at the age of 48, is very important.",Person,https://user-images.trustpilot.com/59a90fe10000ff000ac2c045/73x73.png,Sue Formstone,https://uk.trustpilot.com/users/59a90fe10000ff000ac2c045,Thing,ICS Learn,Organization,Trustpilot,https://uk.trustpilot.com,Rating,5

I was incredibly disappointed with the instructions/guidance given and I had to query things with my tutor and student services at almost every step of the way. A couple of examples:
1. When I came to upload my assignments, the guidance advised me to remember to upload test papers and my ILM cover sheet. My main issues were that a) I had no test papers and b) I wasn't given a cover sheet. When I spoke to student support, they advised that processes have changed and the instructions hadn't been updated. Apparently, this was the first time someone has highlighted this issue to ICS, although I notice things still haven't changed. Obviously submitting work can be very stressful and this added frustration didn't help.

2. There isn't really any guidance to explain how you're actually meant to upload your assignments and I don't really think it's straight forward.",Person,,Rob Squire,https://uk.trustpilot.com/users/5004484700006400011d59cb,Thing,ICS Learn,Organization,Trustpilot,https://uk.trustpilot.com,Rating,3

This is going to be a long review, however it will really show you the amazing work ICS do especially Melissa Lieberman and my tutor Stpehen. 

When i was 16 (2 years ago) i failed my GCSE Maths with a grade G, When i revealed my results to my teacher, she told me that it would be a waste of time to re-sit my exam and it would be IMPOSSIBLE to pass. I was teased for having bad grades in my exams, I have never liked maths, to be fair I HATED IT WITH A PASSION.


One day I decided that i wanted to re-sit my exams, The comment my teacher made was my motivation to prove to her that it is possible for me to pass.

I came across ICS Learn online where i decided to join them (end of 2016), WOW! The best decision i have EVER made. The online lessons by the AMAZING Melissa Lieberman helped me soooo much, i would look forward to Tuesdays and Thursdays (for the online lessons) , the lessons made you feel as though you were part of a classroom with other fellow students trying to achieve their own dreams. Melissa (the best teacher on this planet) would make the lessons sooo easy to understand and if i never understood anything i would email her (where she replies so fast) and helps me to understand anything that confused me.

The assignments and online tasks as well as the help of my amazing tutors Melissa and Stephen helped me sooooo much.

Melissa was my motivator she NEVER made me feel as though i was stupid or thick she really raised my confidence in maths and fed us soooooooooo many tips and tricks to help us with our studies. I cannot explain how GREAT the resources are at ICS Learn and the proof of how amazing they are were in my grades...

Fast forward to today: 24/08/2017, I went to pick up my results this morning and I passed (foundation maths) with a 5!!!! (old grade B), I would never have thought i would love maths as much as i do now, i would never have thought that i would pass my GCSE maths. All thanks to the amazing Melissa and Stephen as well as the people working at ICS, they reallly made my dream come true and i am sooo happy that i decided to join ICS Learn because without them i would never have fell in love with maths as much as i love it now.


If you are umming and ahhing on weather you should join ICS, I would say DO IT!!! You really will not regret it.

When I explained what I wanted to do, she explained how easy everything worked, and how the courses are now all online so can be up and  running pretty quickly. When I said I wanted to go ahead straight away with my maths GCSE but not the other courses just yet, there was no pressure to sell other courses to me  which I liked.
She said if I was happy to go ahead she could ring me in 10 minutes to take my details and enrol me as I wanted to pay in instalments,and she rang when she said she would!
It's fantastic that ICS learn don't penalise people who aren't in work either as most distance learning providers will only allow you to pay in instalments if you are in work. I'm disabled therefore on a low income so it is brilliant that I can still afford to study with a provider like ics as colleges are no longer an option for many disabled people as you have to be able to be seeking work to get reduced rates for courses or take out very expensive government loans if your over a certain age. ICS makes studying affordable again so thank you!! 
Margaret was lovely on the phone, gave me all the information i asked for, and said I can contact her if I need to know anything else. 
I'm really excited to get started on the course and I can't recommend ICS learn highly enough to anyone who wants to further their education, whatever their age. I'm 42 and giving it a go still! 
Also if I want to add further courses i can get a discount off them which is an added bonus as I know I will want to do that at some stage!",Person,,Lucy Roberts,https://uk.trustpilot.com/users/598dcfff0000ff000aba7d94,Thing,ICS Learn,Organization,Trustpilot,https://uk.trustpilot.com,Rating,5

Every question I had was answered clearly for me with additional detail and information along the way.  At the end of our first call I literally had every piece of knowledge available for me to make the decision on studying online or not.

If I am being totally honest Dafina was the determining factor behind me deciding to go with ICS learn.

Anne Marie was extremely helpful and understanding and said to come back when I was ready.   No pushing me to enrol there and then.   I had looked at the same course with other companies but they became pushy for me to enrol.   Therefore when I was in a position to enrol I came directly back to ICS.

Whilst my experience may be different from others, my advice would be to only contact ICS if you can immediately enrol on to a course and have capacity to respond to emails/messages with 24 hours. 

I am yet to complete a course with ICS so I cannot comment on this, however, I do not appreciate their approach in gaining new clientele, the constant messages were too much especially juggling a busy work/life balance, I felt as though I was being chased for a committment I was yet to make.

She took the time to answer all of my questions and made the choice to go with ICS Learn really easy. Having someone to speak to made it really easy to enrol and Anne Marie made the experience personal to me, not like she was just dealing with another client. 
I would be happy to recommend ICS Learn to anyone else who was thinking of enrolling. 
I will hopefully be starting the course shortly.

I specifically found the examples she works through during the live sessions beneficial because they progress from introducing a skill to applying a skill against a GCSE question/ context. I was concerned that I may have struggled learning the Grade 7-9 topics through a webinar, however the breakdown and explanation of skills by Melisa perfect. Patience and understanding is shown where you do not feel like you are in the deep end. 

I have emailed for support on 5 -6 occasions and Melissa has always responded quickly to help explain a topic or check a calculation or point me in the direction of further examples/ resources. The support provided felt like I was just visiting a tutor down the road. I would certainly recommend taking a qualification with ICSLearn and further praise Melisa and the team for their support and delivery.

I will return again,

The tutor seemed nice enough although spelt my name incorrectly on every feedback sent back to me even though I have clearly entered it on my submitted work and spelt it correctly myself. In the first assignment, ironically a spelling assignment there was a spelling mistake in the feedback.

The feedback on individual assignments was very poor, it was very minimal and not very descriptive on how to improve, just a few lines on what I did wrong, nothing about what I did right. I had to go back to the tutor more than once asking for clarification on what was required.

Being a distance learning provider I feel they do not really grasp the pitfalls of distance learning and the level of support that is required.

I got through the course and I am happy with my results, unfortunately it turns out that what you achieved means nothing at all to ICS as you have to arrange your exam separately anyway and they is no recognition at all of your work completed with them, no certificate to confirm that you have completed their course work or anything, I find this a bit sad and it makes the statements that they are really not that bothered at all.

It is very difficult to get through and I wouldnt recommend doing a course this way.  it looks like my deadline will run out before I have time to finish and I guess they will make me pay more to continue.

Without telling you, your access is disabled after 9 months, again with no communication.  When I contacted them about this I was advised that I had to pay to access the site and therefore submit my final assignment.  I completed and passed my assignment and heard nothing for nearly 7 weeks so contacted them after logging on to see an incorrect grade and no access to any other information.  I have been advised that my assessment will go to the EV within the next 8 weeks and then it will be a further 8-12 weeks for certification. Had I not contacted them, I doubt that this would have been picked up.

A terrible user experience from my perspective, although the response from the assessor was always very swift.  It's a shame about the back office processes and the support on this distance learning course.  It's not cheap and was wholly disappointing; it wasn't worth the effort of re-doing this level of qualification.

They don't appear to have any support for people suffering with mental health issues.  I could have cancelled my direct debit which I did but they also threatened me with debt collectors which is not what I needed so I continued to pay.  Not Helpful at all.

5032,Review,2017-05-05T13:30:27+00:00,I feel embarrassed for choosing ICS,en,"I would just like to advise you to consider other distance learning providers. My experience with this learning provider has been an unsuccessful waste of time. They continue to take money from me, knowing that I have no intention of using or continuing the course. I am reaching out to other potential students to give them a heads up before they end up in a similar situation to mine.
 ICS are pretty high on my list of unethical organisations at this point. Their customer service and complaints department were dismissive and I felt ridiculed so I don't contact ICS anymore, instead I have been reaching out privately to individuals to reconsider before signing a contract. After speaking with other potential students, I can confirm that ICS are very keen to get signatures and money before fully understanding the customers situation and suitability for a course. 

When I first complained, there was no mention of the cancellation procedure and cancellation fee and by the time I dug up my cancellation rights, I had already paid for everything.






[Edit] in response to ICS reply:

when you read the public reply from ICS, keep in mind that I gave feedback on several different issues which lead to my dissatisfaction. See how the organisation latch onto one issue which they are insistent on dismissing and going as far as to blame me.

Feel free to contact me if you have any further questions about the company, I have spoken to other customers who have also been let down by ICS and it is important for me to make sure that people know what they are getting into.",Person,,Six Seven,https://uk.trustpilot.com/users/590c7e670000ff000a94d3ed,Thing,ICS Learn,Organization,Trustpilot,https://uk.trustpilot.com,Rating,1

I paid £840+ for this course and received books relating to the first 2 of my 5 assessments (worth £15-17.99 each) but I later had to purchase the books relating to the rest of the course and revision guides direct from the osborne website priced at £5.99 each for 5 revision guides and £11.99 each (when bought online) for the remaining 3 books. Most of the online content either just referred to a page in the books or was just a hyperlink to the AAT website. The pros are that there are discussion forums where you can talk to other students online and you can send a message to a tutor if you have a question but I only used this service twice. The customer service at the start when I first enquired was very friendly but I once I'd started making payments I felt I was just left to it; no follow up call to check on how I was doing/If I was happy with the service (which ICS say they will do). I got no information about who my ""tutor"" was etc so i'm not entirely sure what my £800+ fee paid for since I had to purchase most of the guide books myself, most of the ""learning"" sections on the ICS website simply referred to the book and the most helpful content and mock tests were on the AAT website anyway. I've nearly completed my qualification but don't really feel that I was aided much by ICS and today I have tried to log in to my account to update it with my exam results so far and found that they have disabled my account and cut-off all access a few days earlier than the stated end date. I intend to take my AAT Level 3 this year but will just purchase the books from Osborne directly and use the fantastic study support, e-learning modules and mock assessments provided by the AAT website for only £90 a year, saving me approx £650+.",Person,,Rower Pangers,https://uk.trustpilot.com/users/58a6f3bf0000ff000a78912b,Thing,ICS Learn,Organization,Trustpilot,https://uk.trustpilot.com,Rating,2

5209,Review,2017-01-31T18:10:54.588+00:00,Competent in self study then ICS is for you,en,"From the start of the course your promised a personal mentor who can't actually assist on the specific assignment questions and are suppose to keep in contact with you regularly. 

With ICS you pay your fee and it's totally down to you to stay connected. With no deadlines on assignments or real interaction it's very easy to feel neglected. 
The tutors are fine however the impact from a telephone conversation to how a tutor in a classroom would explain things is very different. 
The feedback on the assignment is very poor and doesn't actually help you to improve academically if your not that strong in the area. It's more like a text box exercise for the tutor. 

You don't get a personal touch from ICS or the tutors. 
This is a different way of studying and not for someone who hasn't studied in a long time as well as never done home learning before. 

If your confident in your studying abilities then go for it

Also, please note: ICS makes no mention on their website of hidden fees such as the £60 they apparently charge PER EXAM  - on top of the (considerable) fees charged by the exam centres. Also, they seem reluctant to let you know exactly how much the exam centre fees are - some are quite pricey, so again check in advance of signing up to ensure you can afford it. 

When I asked for any statistics or information about past student/school track records, they dodged the questions and when I asked again, they stopped replying all together. They also wouldn't be drawn on when they take A-level students in for 2019 for some reason, perhaps as they want to recruit still for 2018, and if you don't finish in time, charge you for extending to 2019.

I also notice that they don't appear to deal properly with serious student complaints - make sure you check out the low star ratings for any college including this one, the reasons for it, and the response from the college.

In summary, & according to my research, other colleges offer much more, including (at Oxford Open Learning Trust), double the number of guided learning hours, a person dedicated to helping you find an exam centre near you, money back guarantees if you don't pass your exams, teachers who are guaranteed to be properly qualified etc etc. Not impressed.

Even if you give an incorrect answer she will always explain where you may have gone wrong and go back over the question so that you understand where you went wrong. She always has time for any questions during the lessons. On the VERY odd occasion when she may have made a mistake it's refreshing for the rest of us mere humans to see that even the best can get mixed up when working with numbers ! Melissa makes me feel capable and gives me the confidence to really move forward with understanding maths.

The person I spoke to in the beginning was very friendly and helpful, and apologetic for quoting the wrong price, so I have no complaints about the customer service.

So onto doing my actual course, I was advised to introduce myself to my tutor, so I did and I also asked for his advice, it has been almost 4 days since that message and I haven't had a response, so that's really not helpful. That is a particularly bad thing as great tutor support was one of the things that convinced me to sign up.

5446,Review,2016-09-29T07:19:24+00:00,ICS adult learner,en,"I started with 4 stars but that was taking into account personal hurdles and bumps in the road - Looking solely at live lessons, material and support, ICS is quite excellent. The in-house maths teachers is incredibly accessible and covers everything. Liberman's enthusiasm is certainly a highlight. As well as answering all questions. basic or otherwise, in a non-judgemental way, not wanting anyone to get left behind. The organisation and availability of resources, links, books, websites, contacts is very impressive and only moderately overwhelming.
Interactions with student services and the help desk have been small, but useful and speedy. As the course is starting to get harder, I'll now start using the forums and 'Ask a maths teacher' box. I trust that anything I have difficulty with will be helped. 
Two live sessions a week is great and recordings are released soon after. Very different atmospheres of learning but watching both allows for everything to be covered and understood a lot better.
For adult learners, it's got you covered. Having motivation and routine is becoming essential and these are good things to have either way. O, but it's hard. That will get easier... 
It's good for me. Hope it is for others too.",Person,,Yenni Millar,https://uk.trustpilot.com/users/57ecc0440000ff000a48c73b,Thing,ICS Learn,Organization,Trustpilot,https://uk.trustpilot.com,Rating,5

I have not even started my course yet but the way in which my enquiry into a GCSE Science course was handled was quite simply exemplary!

Any concerns I had were answered and I was made to feel that my best interests were the most important factor in proceeding with the course.

As I said, I have not even started yet but would highly recommend to friends, family and anyone who wants to learn something new or improve upon existing results such as myself - even if it is 15 years after I took the original exams.

Thank you so much Margaret for your supportive and reassuring customer service - there are many call centres and customer contact points that could learn a lifetime of skills and manners when dealing with consumers.

This review is solely based upon the first rate experience I had with Margaret Duffy in just a 12 minute telephone conversation.

5656,Review,2016-06-17T16:25:11+00:00,"Poor communication, absolutely ridiculous",en,"I started A-level English language with this company and immediately asked to change tutors as my first one was quite rude, my second tutor however was lovely and made a lot of effort although feedback was incredibly poor and not informative at all.
I was given the incorrect dates for my coursework deadline repeatedly and never received a response as to why this happened.
Finally, and the reason I have written this review, is 4 days before my final exam, I was told that my tutor was on holiday, I never received notice about this and as a result have no idea about my predicted grade. Finally upon calling them I was told my tutor was on holiday, but this was all too late, as they had prematurely cut me off from all my resources, online access and tutor the day before my exam. I have also not received a response as to why this happened, or attempt to fix this from the company, nor an apology.
As a result I am terrified about my A-levels and my chances of getting into my choice of uni are slim. 
I strongly advise against using this company if you want a calm learning environment and a stress free exam period.",Person,,Natasha Rae Groom,https://uk.trustpilot.com/users/576424610000ff000a2a2bbb,Thing,ICS Learn,Organization,Trustpilot,https://uk.trustpilot.com,Rating,1

Samantha was different, she didn't once try to put me off of other colleges, she didn't even mention them, she was more interested in helping me as a person to decide on the best pathway to take. She has been extremely thorough, helpful and understanding. The college have also provided me with a payment option to make my studies the main priority rather than the cost.

I stumbled on ICS online, read the trust pilot reviews and decided to go with them. The man on the phone reassured me I would have CONSTANT contact with tutors, the website would be easy to use and the content very broad. Within a month I reaised this was not the case. The biology content was literally less than half a ring binder full of badly written basic info that I could have googled in an instant. The BBC BITESIZE content was better than what I was paying hundreds of pounds for. I raised my concerns with ICS and they fobbed my off saying the tutors were there to help and if I wished to cancel I would have to pay £100 cancellation fees?! I instantly cancelled my direct debits. How is this company in ANY WAY here to help academics further their learning. THEN came the debt collector letters. Again I write to ICS and they tell me its a standard letter for people who have fallen behind with their payments and again give me no further help but say someone has been trying to call me (no one had tried to call me!?)
Now I am being hounded by a debt collection agency called THE ZINC GROUP who have added fees on and are sending me threatening letters about recovery. This was all because I tried to better myself and my studies.

5968,Review,2015-10-03T19:01:43+00:00,Excellent experience learning with ICS,en,"Just wanted to write a quick review on my experience of learning through ICS. I have completed a number of Level 3 CIPD course as standalone modules, a full Level 5 and a unit of the Level 7 syllabus.

From the enrolment of each course through to ensuring certificates were issued, everyone who I had any interaction with were extremely helpful, experienced and polite. They understood the courses and were able to provide me with an excellent level of advice and guidance.

The course material is written to a high standard and is written clearly, more importantly it is written in an easy to understand way so there is very little or no room or ambiguity. If I ever needed to clarify my own understanding or needed some additional support and/ or guidance, the mentoring team were there. If they couldn’t help me then I was able to message one of my tutors who, in pretty much every occasion, answered me with a matter of hours. 

The workshops for my level 5 course were helpful and it was good to meet other learners and network. I think my only criticism would be to run a further weekend or have a day’s workshop on employment law; that said support is excellent and at the end of a phone or email.

There was no judgement no matter how stupid I thought my question was. The advice was contextualised and the modules were put into real examples which really helped my learning style. Feedback from the tutors was clear, concise and stretching; marking was quick and efficiently turnaround within 24hrs or quicker.

Having completed 5 courses with CIPD through distance learning, my knowledge and understanding has been tested and confirmed. I feel I have learnt loads over the past 18 months and would definitely recommend the ICS to anyone wanting to learn and grow as an individual.

I just watched his latest webinar on Corporate Social Responsibility. It was insightful (as he did his PHD on the subject), but it was also balanced and very actual. He highlighted very current cases and gave enough references for further deeper studies. Considering that he did it for a small group of students, I like to congratulate him on his positive and enthusiastic delivery, and like to to encourage him to keep his sincere and intrinsic desire to help us ICS students on all levels.

Thank you, Dr. Littler !

Once off line you can contact Melissa during week day office hours as well as another tutor during out of office hours.
To have such a friendly and understanding teacher has worked wonders for me already.  I must say I felt completely useless at maths before starting this course and I am now starting to have some faith in myself.

6106,Review,2015-07-23T01:41:50+00:00,ICS LEARN | Who says distance learning can be frustrating,en,"If you’ve come this far, then no doubt considering distance learning, and trying to figure out which company to choose.  You will most probably have heard some or all of the following comments: “You will have to have lots of motivation to succeed.  There won’t be much support; you’ll be on your own with your books. Good luck trying to speak with you tutor if you need guidance or feedback.”

I signed up with ICS to study a recognised certification course fast track. Time is of the essence for me and yes I'm motivated. The company provides course books for each module that are professional both in  content and presentation.  I have attended workshops covering four modules so far; each one animated by its dedicated tutor. In addition to the professional body’s own website, which provides a wealth of information and interactive tools, ICS also runs a student website and online community. 

Tutors are available to help with any concerns a student may have and give expert guidance. As part of its course resources, ICS also runs webinars and if you are not able to attend, the audio and slides are made available on their website rapidly. This is another great way to interact with tutors and stidents alike,  I have also exchanged emails and spoken with tutors over the telephone.  

One final comment: My tutor is currently on her summer vacation. This might have posed a problem with another company, not with ICS though.  So, I would like to give a special shout out of thanks to Dr S. Littler for his valuable assistance during my tutor’s short absence.

Great communication included a generic ""thank you for your request"" email followed swiftly by a personal email from a course advisor who promised a phone call. Before phoning me she texted to ask when I was free and got in touch shortly afterwards.
She clarified a couple of points which I had questions about, and enabled me to pay either by installments or in total there and then. However, there was no pressure to make the decision as to whether or not to proceed at that point, it was purely that I had sufficient information for me to make the decisioon to go ahead.
Very painless registration process!

I have had a terrible experience with ICS, and have not used the folders or online support at all this year as it was such a hindrance. My coursework module was incorrectly graded with a 'glitch' allowing me to use it as a template for all my work going forward, waste 4 months on it, and believe that what I would have sent off would have been an A grade. It would have actually been a fail. and seeing as I have a university place reliant on these grades I was devastated. I have since had to pay for an actual tutor  which I should have just done in the first place. the exam board websites (which you will need anyway) are so much more helpful. My first exam is today, and if I pass NONE of the credit will go to ICS. If you are considering A Levels then PLEASE look into alternatives before diving into distance learning, there are so many cheaper alternatives! I should note that I was given a £100 refund. But seeing as overall I payed between £700 and £800 (and £1000 to an exam center to sit the exams) I can't say this is a good use of anyones hard earned money.


Edit regarding the response below from ICS: I'm sorry but due to the levels of distress your company has caused me unless I will be entitled to a further refund I have no desire to contact your customer service line, but will make it very clear to others so future A Level students do not make the same mistake.

I am deeply disappointed to have already spent over £3,000 on a continuous lack of support and to find out I have to pay for additional tutor support, exams as well as the abhorrent payment and study plan which when I signed up for I was told was flexible, its not - if you take a study break they continue to take payments from your account ; all of which I was not advised of prior to signing up, even though I specifically asked this very question before signing up to study with them as I knew I would need the full flexibility of paying and studying at a time that was convenient to me. Complete waste of money and a huge money making scheme, particularly when you are spending over £6,000 on a course! 

Just be aware of what you are signing up to... it may not be as flexible and supportive as you think !

*update*
Offering a refund of £130 is quite frankly unacceptable... 

If you entered into an agreement with a company and in doing so you agreed with the terms and conditions of the company contract you wouldn't expect them to with hold the fact that you need to purchase the company uniform. By entering a contract all information should be correctly displayed and given as a matter of formality, by with holding information - particularly relating to additional costs - you are committing 'maladministration'. 

ICS deliberately with held information at the time of entering into a contract and based on the complaints forums I have come across I am not the first person to highlight this.

I have been promised month after month that I will be receiving my qualifications and certificates and that this will be resolved shortly. Even on Trust pilot they said it will be by the end of April. Now they say end of June at the earliest. 
After speaking to the awarding body they confirmed that they will not be certifying. Even though I gained distinctions across the board.

This company are full of lies. They will promise you the world at sign up but once you complete your course, you will not be certified. A total waste of time and money are ICS. 

A fool and his money are soon parted. I guess I was a fool. Make sure you are not. This is why they are no where near the top 20 distance learning centres in the UK.

Just look at the date of their reply for proof of their lies... 24th April ..this has been changed every month by ICS when I have asked for certification. I expect them to tell more lies and change it again shortly. Don't fall for this scam.

It's very easy to study and you can study in your spare time; there's no classroom pressure on you as you are in the comfort of your own home (which is what I love the most!)

I have successfully completed distance learning courses before (with another provider) and thought I would hit the ground running but unfortunately this was not the case. I found the student forums and website unappealing and the tutors hard to reach- when I first joined I was advised that I had to go through a mentor to book a phone appointment with my tutor, which was all too complicated and off putting with my busy lifestyle! 
However after attending a fantastic residential weekend with great tutors & new friends and making contact with tutors/mentors such as Dr Stephen Littler, who are so supportive and happy to answer queries at anytime of the day, through email, phone, or even LinkedIn etc, my opinion of ICS has completely transformed. 
My review is currently 4 stars however ICS seems to be constantly reviewing and improving its processes and applications and I think that by the time I complete my course I will be willing to rate ICS as five star - watch this space!

My advice to anyone considering studying with ICS is get involved, call your tutors, get familiar with the resources and attend the residential ASAP because all of these steps will make you feel so much more comfortable with this mode of study and it will make your course material much easier to digest.

Any question I've had has been answered promptly and they are really keen to support you with academic issues as well as logistical stuff.  That's really good for me as I haven't studied for around 10 years so it's nice to know that I can reach out to a tutor and they'll be there to talk me through stuff.

Mel is an absolute star. I think the whole concept of attempting GCSE maths when in the first instance I had no mathematical grounding has been extremely scary.  Knowing over the years how important it is to have that passable 'C' grade and not having obtained it has omitted me from choice career options. However, Mel's guidance and suggested study outlines has put me on track to positively facing this academic gap head on. It's great seeing demonstrations in the ICS student community explaining how a formula is worked out and having the ability to just  'pause' it , and play it again until it makes sense, something you can't do in a classroom environment,  yet  this helps to further aid understanding. I know Mel is just a phone call or email away and extremely responsive to every question I have asked, her support is invaluable.

Now to the course itself. I thoroughly enjoyed my course, this was not through help from anyone but my own. I am actually genuinely surprised I completed this course with the lack of help I had. The previous tutor 'Charles' never marked any of my work nor assist that often, sometimes it would take weeks to get a response. But still I persisted and re-searched anything I needed to know and got on with what I thought was right. My manager at work (an MEng graduate in Electronic engineering) was actually more of a mentor then anyone at ICS for at least 9 months of the course. 

And so Steven Atkins appears on the scene. He marked everything i had submitted within a week of starting. He gave me positive and negative feedback where necessary and I completed the course. Unfortunately too late to get a merit or distinction but at this stage a pass was at least not wasting my money.  

ICS seem like they have put some measures into place to avoid the issues I experienced for the majority of my course. I wouldn't study with them again, this is mostly due to the fact I can't study the next level I require.

When i first joined ICS last Sepetember i really felt that I was left on my own to get on with it with no help at all from any of my tutors. I would book calls to speak to my tutors and sometimes never get a call back. I actually nearly quit and was prepared to pay my employer back as i couldn't go on with it any longer. However... somehow im still doing it. I believe that since Stephen Littler has joined the organisation he has saved ICS. He really makes the effort to call and i feel that he genuinely tries to help you. And... you get the feeling that he actually cares! and wants the best for you. When i first received a call from Stephen I was taken aback as it was shocking that a tutor was calling to check up on me and make sure that I was ok and if i needed any help. No one from ICS had ever called me before. Since then hes been really helpful and actually managed to get me my first merit! :) He definitely motivated me as i was at a point of giving up. The constant engagement is great. Feeling free to just call up whenever i have any question and i know that he will be there for me to help with any queries is really good! I really liked the webinar he organised. I think this is going to be really good for ICS and the students. I just find it strange that this wasn't happening before..... as this was what my idea of distance learning was so i was suprised to find that i just get sent the text books and that i'm left on my own. For this review i would have given ICS a 1 star rating and Stephen a 5 star.. So... i have decided to go with a 3! There definitely needs to be more engagement with the tutors and students!

6441,Review,2014-06-04T21:56:55+00:00,Not everyone's cup of tea...,en,"Inspite of what im about to write, I'd like to point out that, firstly, i passed my exams and secondly, i got a refund.
I purchased the IGCSE science course, which i later realised was just a textbook of information, something i could have bought elsewhere for a fraction of the price.
In my opinion, the course title is inaccurate, i am aware that the webpages now state that the course 'prepares you to take your IGCSE' but this in now way informs the purchaser of what else they have to do if they want to actually take and pass the exam.
The material sent was written against an out of date speculation, and it was only by cross referencing this against the new spec that i was able to see when the gaps were. I discovered this about a third of the way though my study and when i raised it with ICS was told ""it shouldn't really make a difference"", not the professional, reassuring answer you want to hear, especially when you've just forked out another £230 to register for the exams (and which was on top of the ICS course fees).
There were a lot of errors in this material, which makes it really difficult to learn when you dont have anyone immediately available to talk to amd check it out - i was often left wondering if it was me who had misunderstood the material of if there was, in fact, an error! This is the last thing a distance learning student needs as it makes you feel you cannot trust the material and it gives you a complex (which is no good for your confidence).
The online support was a joke! Tutor support was hit and miss, to say the least (they would take days to respond, although when they did they were helpful). It was only through my own understanding of adult learning theories that i was able to make sense of how i could tackle and get though this course in order to get my qualification. To cover the gaps, i had to pay for a private tutor and additional resources and as a result, I was the person fellow learners would go to on the community forums to answer their questions. 
I really believe i could have passed my exams without any ICS material or support and could have done it using a current spec (free to download) some topic books ( £10 or less from ebay) and a few down loaded free past exam papers. All ICS provided was a framework, and anyone with the right attuitude and motivation could do that for themselves.
The other thing was timing. The 'blurb' on the website makes you think you have 12 months from when purchase the course. Not true! You need to check when the exams are, these are external to the ICS course and so may not reflect the amount of time you have to complete the material. I had 7 months, which of course i didnt realise at the time! I also had to commit and pay £230 for the exams 4 months into the course, otherwise id have to wait another 12 months, by which time my so-called online support would have finished and i'd probably have lost all my desire to complete it! 
In total, all these additional fees tripppled the cost of my qualification!
The one thing i can credit ICS with is the fact that, due to investing so much financially, i had no choice but to knuckle down and study and tbh i went into those exams not feeling confident at all. So you could imagine my joy on discovering I'd passed!
There were so many times i wanted to give up, but i simply couldn't afford to! Once you buy, you're trapped; first the course fees, then the huge exam costs, then all the additional costs to make sure you pass! It snowballs so quickly, and if you're not in a position to be able to spend all that extra money you'll just jack it in at the first hurdle!
My advice to anyone considering the alevel / gcse courses, is do your homework first! Understand EVERYTHING that is required before you part with your money, and be prepared to work your socks off! Once you've done that, you'll probably realise that you can do everything you need to get your qualifications without having to pay a cent to ICS! Ignore this advice at your peril, but be warned, it will be the easiest £300 odd quid you've thrown away....
Ps, after my experience i was able to compile a well evidenced complaint and was awarded a full refund. 
I award 2 stars: 1 for my refund and the 2nd, because i did in fact get my qualification (with no thanks to ICS)",Person,,Lou ,https://uk.trustpilot.com/users/538a9110000064000176b1d0,Thing,ICS Learn,Organization,Trustpilot,https://uk.trustpilot.com,Rating,2

- The website / study materials all have different codes: as someone that works in L&D , I ended up spending an afternoon sorting it all out so they all matched up and I knew I was comparing 'apples with apples'
- The assessment questions are poorly worded in some cases, and do not correlate to what is set out in the learning objectives (I am basing this on feedback from a tutor - which had no relevance to the question asked, so I am guessing the question is unclear)

6454,Review,2013-03-28T18:37:45+00:00,Fantastic,en,"As a whole my experience has been great. Not only are they patient with regards to submission meaning that it doesn't matter how often you send an assisgment they are also very prompt in returning papers. 
Having studied a few courses with ICS i feel that the experience is getting better with each course and i do hope to study again with ICS as i feel that a home study course is better than college because you can work to your own pace
I would (and do) recommend ICS to anyone that says to me that they want to study but doesn't have time to go to college",Person,,Rebecca Creamer,https://uk.trustpilot.com/users/51548df9000064000135e10b,Thing,ICS Learn,Organization,Trustpilot,https://uk.trustpilot.com,Rating,5
6455,Review,2013-03-27T11:07:51+00:00,"Easy to understand course notes, but poor assessment examples",en,I found that the course notes given at the start of the course were easy to read and comprehend. The majority of the references provided were useful. However the assessment examples given at the end of each section were not as detailed as those actually used by CIM. I would suggest attempting previous examination questions provided through CIM.,Person,,Anonymous,https://uk.trustpilot.com/users/5152d307000064000135b186,Thing,ICS Learn,Organization,Trustpilot,https://uk.trustpilot.com,Rating,3
6456,Review,2013-03-25T14:26:21+00:00,Something so simple can change your life!,en,"I found getting course information easy and it didn't take me long to find the course I wanted. I telephoned the office and everything was processed very quickly. Even though I am overseas my materials arrived shortly after I signed up, although this wasn't included in the cost of the course.
I submitted my first assignment, it was nerve racking and waited. Nothing for 3 weeks. I hadn't heard back from my tutor queries either. On contacting the office by email I had my problem sorted in about 3 days and my support period extended because of the delay. However,  I wanted to submit a submission today and the system is down for maintenance. I hope this doesn't take too long as I rely on the email system to submit pieces of my work. I am really enjoying the course but the technical problems have taken the shine off it a little.",Person,,Patricia,https://uk.trustpilot.com/users/51505e8d0000640001357047,Thing,ICS Learn,Organization,Trustpilot,https://uk.trustpilot.com,Rating,4

6458,Review,2013-03-21T12:20:22+00:00,"Not bad, could be better at times",en,"Whenever I've phoned up the staff have always been friendly and helpful, plus there's a live chat service too which is good. However, there have been times when I've sent an email request and got no reply and sometimes when testpapers are sent for marking, that take ages to come back. You can pay in instalments, which is handy, plus the courses are varied. If you pay in instalments, its interest free and you can pay over 10 months.",Person,,Mrs Viv Randolph,https://uk.trustpilot.com/users/5069806f000064000122ebf1,Thing,ICS Learn,Organization,Trustpilot,https://uk.trustpilot.com,Rating,4
6459,Review,2013-03-21T12:02:56+00:00,Unacceptable.,en,"I have been a student with ICS since last year I have been trying to work towards a Diploma in Dog Obedience. And I'm very unhappy with the way ICS has handled my complaints and advice. I used the 'Ask Tutor' section on the website awaiting a reply that would atleast be a day or two, I waited 5 days and rang up you company and they replied with the tutor has atleast ""7 days to reply"" which I thought was a ridiculous time scale as your awaiting an answer and it could took an unbelivable time to get an answer to you. But I waited another two days and said ""I'm not getting a reply so I'm with holding my direct debits"" as I thought this was unacceptable of the company. I eventually got a reply after 15 days which left me very unhappy and not want to continue with my course if I was been seen to this slowly. Overal, I don't think I received the help that I needed during this course and I'm very unhappy with the way your company has dealt with everything I will not be taking up another course with ICS again and not referring the company to any family or friends. I hope you take this into consideration thank you.",Person,,Rebecca Porter,https://uk.trustpilot.com/users/514af6f0000064000134fdea,Thing,ICS Learn,Organization,Trustpilot,https://uk.trustpilot.com,Rating,2

Over all I fully enjoyed the course. The ICS  tutors were rapid at marking/responding to coursework. The only thing I have had a problem with is recieving my certificate. I requested it back in December 2012 and ICS have responded to let me know there would be/is a delay but I wouldn't expect it to take 3 months or more!
