The video lessons are very good and goes very much into detail. So, much detail that I had to skip some lessons as I already had knowledge in it.

The assignments are not that easy and really tests your skills and don't expect them to be lenient on you for passing the module for the sake of marking it. I had to submit one of my assignments 6 times before they passed me which is good because this is how you learn when you are challenged.

16,Review,2021-06-07T14:34:09+00:00,Best Way to Find a New Job,en,"I am very thankful for Udacity and its nanodegree programs.  I have a pretty technical background, but limited experience in the AI/ML realm.  I started applying for jobs over a year ago that would be more involved with AI/ML, but could not receive any offers because I did not have that much professional experience applying AI/ML techniques.  It came to the point that I had to decide whether to continue with my current job for the long term and not pursue my passion for AI/ML or take a temporary step back from applying for jobs and take some courses that could show companies that, even though I was not applying AI/ML professionally, I am interested enough to learn about these techniques independently.  I found out about Udacity and completed taking the Deep Learning and Computer Vision nanodegree programs.  Within six months of starting these courses, I received two offers from companies doing AI/ML work, and plan to begin my new job next week.  The Udacity courses give you a very strong foundation in any topic you want to learn.  Since they are only meant to take a few month to complete each nanodegree, clearly they cannot dig deep into the minor details about how some algorithms work, but they do provide immense amount of additional resources for the user to read in case they want to learn more about a certain topic.  Again I want to thank Udacity so much for these courses, searching for a job is extremely stressful and frustrating, but knowing I have strong AI/ML background now gave me the confidence to speak intelligently during my interviews and get a new job!",Person,,Robert Sorbello,https://uk.trustpilot.com/users/60be2e5b35fa1b00191cc846,Thing,Udacity,Organization,Trustpilot,https://uk.trustpilot.com,Rating,5

I feel that some topics are really basic while others can be challenging, probably that's because Im familiar with machine-learning techniques but not with finances.

So far it really seems the effort you put into developing this program which from my picky perspective it really holds to the high expectations that Udacity creates.

Different from other platforms where an introductory course is labeled as advanced this nanodegree is a comprehensive course of the topics related to finances providing also plenty of additional material for us to learn more.

Of course, I don't expect to be a quant after this program but it's a solid step forward building AI-powered trading algorithm.",Person,,PublicName,https://uk.trustpilot.com/users/6018d1e1cd1f21001ae4eeb8,Thing,Udacity,Organization,Trustpilot,https://uk.trustpilot.com,Rating,5

I had a horrid time managing everything. And to my bad luck, I and my immediate family got infected twice from Covid within a span of 45 days.  Obviously I wasn't in a position to continue.
Hence I requested them to put my access on hold for 45 days ( the access was for 3 months ). I wasn't even asking for an extension, just that the access to be put on hold so that I can work on it after my personal health issues get resolved.

After multiple emails, all they have done is to extend the access by 15 days. Thats what they said the best they can do as per policy. Is policies are made for people or the other way round. How can someone be so insensitive? Taking advantage of a student's personal misery.

1- I want to learn great technical skills from a professional of people online, with good projects + professional mentors who also could answer my questions not only about the courses/projects but also about career options. That feeling makes me no lonely.

I bought several courses from Udemy(comperatively cheaper) however all I see is that a guy uploads a course, and his course is at the top, competing with the others. However, all he does better than others is ""Search Engine Optimaziation"" inside Udemy. Nothing more...

But at Udacity, I shied away from purchasing a course which was more expensive becuase all I though that if that course would not teach me anythin? and that feeling made me feel afraid of spending my money for nothing, and feeling like a fraud.

Buttt untilll.. they offered me a 30 days free offer, and now I entered a course I am most passionate with it, and I learned a lot of things during that 'lockdown period' also. I am not wasting my time exactly.

Now after the trial is over, the course is expected to finish(on demand) within 6 months, and I will just keep my subscription by paying. That was an amazing offer from you.

I paid over £200 for a course which later turns into and £80 a month subscription (which was not mentioned before i paid for the course). On top of all that the course was so slow an uninformative, they barely brush over each topic then leave it to you to figue out on your own (with the help of google). After all this i eventually gave up once the subscription started. For someone who is on the autisic spectrum i felt there was no help or support for this course then once i contacted udacity through the live chat to cancel the person i spoke to was so rude and condescending then once i had cancelled he insulted me. I have all the evidence but cannot contact anyone a udacity as they make it nearbon impossible to contact them.

Obviously the didn't refund the money because of the time interval I had, been studying for 2 weeks after seeing too many broken/outdated info just fed up. Feels like a beta tester reporting all of this stuff but I'm still paying for it. Not funny.

* the courses are great, great video quality, great graphics, great content

So you need to pay for extra months (i.e., after your bundle comes the monthly renewal). Also please note, monthly renewal is set as automated. So remember to cancel before.

Some glitches (outdated exercise results) slowed my progress. You need mentors' help to get going. Thing is it usually takes 3/4 questions & answers to get a more or less clear picture of what you need. This slows down your progress as they do not reply instantly. Some mentors are good, others give you vague answers (it looks like they want to gain time).

If your level of programming is good already, I recommend a Nanodegree with them.

Practice makes perfect, and project is a good idea. Moreover, explaining by example, pointing a point for analysis. helps mind test and work better. Thought lessons are simple, I hope it is supported by an optional ""work book"" to apply and test many exercises, and this point to be optional. But examples (visual, written, and watched) should be for every point. May there be a certain book for ""examples"" as well. 

Questions of learners, and answers in the platform, helped me save time, and there's still much to know, In-Sha'-Allah. I hope we collaborate to give advice on national or global scale, work on it to apply. what we learn. Sharing is a best investment, and a best motive.

I would, however, change the Nanodegree name to ""Programming Fundamentals"" to make it sound more professional, as ""Introduction to programming"" doesn't do it justice and sounds too amateurish. 

To add to one's LinkedIn or CV, ""Certificate in Introduction to Programming"" just sounds awful and reminds of one of those cheap and poorly designed Udemy courses.
On the other hand, ""Certificate in Programming Fundamentals"" sounds way better and conveys that idea that one possesses solid core skills that can be built upon.",Person,https://user-images.trustpilot.com/5d872bd139cf1447a26f52a5/73x73.png,Antonio Riccelli,https://uk.trustpilot.com/users/5d872bd139cf1447a26f52a5,Thing,Udacity,Organization,Trustpilot,https://uk.trustpilot.com,Rating,5

Also some exercises don't mention the importance of cleaning the data enough. Maybe in text, but I would have expected a video of the teacher explicitly asking for this. Also, this course requires ""basic knowledge"" of Tableau and SQL. Would be great to have a ""mini test"" before starting so we the students could evaluate if we have this ""basic knowledge"". If we do, we can continue, if not, derive people to the specific courses (which BTW are free in Udacity) for study. This feedback is just things that could improve.

Learning journey at Udacity is truly fruitful, for me; working on delivering projects before its deadlines was the most exciting part of the course, it kept me always eager and racing time to make this happen on time! 

Videos and links in the instructor notes gives rich knowledge on the contents being illustrated, Lessons' structures are very organized and walks through the contents step by step, showing examples of how-to-do this.

However, I've encountered some videos that was supposed to be easy-to-understand by the instructors were neglecting many small details in the illustration while I was waiting for, this made me a little uncomfortable but on the other side it pushed to me find the information on my own, which improved my Googling answers skills.

510,Review,2020-12-14T10:38:01+00:00,Of Beginnings and Project Structures,en,"The first project was a great start to grasp the end-to-end ml pipeline. However, since my last encounter with a project for a udacity nanodegree things seem to have changed. The degree of difficulty seems to have decreased, or my skills have improved. Either way, this could be remedied by making the subsequent projects progressively difficult with respect to one particular stage of the machine learning process; just have the student explore one or two alternative methods of achieving their goal. You could randomly assign different approaches to explore than the base one. For example, in the 'Creating a Sentiment Analysis Web App',  a student could be asked to replace the processing function such that it used word2vec and another student could be asked to implement glove. This could be made an optional part and included in the rubric accordingly. What it could also do is promote some discussion in the chat regarding these approaches.

1. It was hard to understand the person on the video. I was expecting a person with clear English and better pronunciation.

2. The videos are hosted on Youtube. They are unlisted YouTube videos. Can you imagine paying 1500 dollars for a course while the author behind it is using ""unlisted youtube videos"" to teach students? It felt very unprofessional.

3. Uses examples and case studies from 2010. Please use recent case studies. 

4. The refund policy: You have only two days to decide if you want to continue doing the course or not. That was the last straw for me. The course maker was not behind their program. They are not sure if the users would like their program or not. I wanted to browse the course without the fear of not being able to get the full refund. It was not even 24 hours, and the staff told me that I had a couple of minutes left to decide or I don't get any refund at all.

I don't think I'd be exaggerating, if I say that without basic knowledge of programming, it seems almost impossible to find an entry point to this ""world"". 
This Nanodegree program made that step almost seem easy. 

Thumbs up!

Only negative aspect for me is, that its not possible after completing a lesson like ""Intro to HTML"", you're not able to go back, and review the practices and videos to refresh the knowledge. I understand that after completing the whole degree it will be locked, but why lock it WHILE I'm enrolled? You only get a really watered down summary of the whole lesson. 

Thumbs down!

So for everyone enrolling, I can only recommend to keep writing a personal, detailed summary as you progress through each lesson. 

But still, all in all a great Intro, easy to access, and made fun with all the small, practical exercises and hands on examples.",Person,,Felix Harder,https://uk.trustpilot.com/users/5fa07920bacc87001cbaed20,Thing,Udacity,Organization,Trustpilot,https://uk.trustpilot.com,Rating,4

All examples are made up with unrealistic numbers (like prices being numbers from 1 to 5) and the methods shown are deemed as ""not working any more"" - and there is non technical or sentimental analysis whatsoever apart from some general momentum strategy or break trough theory.

I much prefer doing my work locally in my IDE (PyCharm). However, this has been difficult because installing psycopg2 (a PostgreSQL package) was laborious. Using the Udacity online workspace, while I appreciate all that was built into it, just lacks easy navigation and code-completion, which an IDE has for a heavy project like project 1.
The Knowledge center had lots of useful information. I just had to be willing to take the time to use it, but its search functions are well built.
The curriculum structure is great. I think it's encouraging.
I like the habit of 30 days of Udacity. Though I don't read all emails/messages from the social media staff member, I read at least half of them, which is uplifting that humans are behind the scenes cheering us all on.

However, I found that the time frame of 3 months, which was the time frame to complete the program for the bundle I paid for, is too short for someone who spends 1-2 hours a day studying. The SQL concepts alone take time to sink in and only knowing how they work well is how I'd be able to produce code that's accurate and that works.

The projects are great for practicing, but having to constantly research and troubleshoot is very time consuming. I don't believe is worth the money. 

Their customer service is also not good. I joined in January through a $714 for 4 months offer, but I couldn't start straight away. The day before the offer was expiring I went to buy it and asked them to delay my start day 2 weeks, so that I didn't lose that study time. They said that it wasn't possible, so I went ahead and bought it anyway. Afterwards I saw that they extended the offer for some weeks, so I could have bought it 2 weeks after without losing any study time. Noone bothered to tell me, though. I know I should have gone back to claim but I didn't have time.

Also, it is not possible to cancel without chatting with a rep, and as soon as they see you leaving they send you a canned response offering a ""75% discount"" on their $399 monthly fee, which is not what I am paying (my deal is for $199 a month, like most). So, they are clearly just offering a 50% discount instead. When I asked for a 75% discount on the actual amount I am paying it was denied.

All in all I don't think is a good product, service or company.",Person,,Flat,https://uk.trustpilot.com/users/5f45356f6e8073a2c68059be,Thing,Udacity,Organization,Trustpilot,https://uk.trustpilot.com,Rating,1

Still, udacity Business Analytics Nanodegree was not worth the money for me.

Even from look and feel: Sheets used in the videos lack any formatting (how do you want the students to get used to using some basic color coding?). Some parts very so buggy, that I literally had the feeling somebody created the content right before I enrolled and I was the first user.

What I disliked so far was, that the little programming quizzes and takes don't often show why an answer is wrong. I sometimes wished for an explanation regarding the answers.
In addition, my code review of the first project ""MyReads"" was practically non-existent. It just had the rubric ticked on every aspect that I had got right. Also, I wrote what I liked to be looked at specifically inside the code, but threre was no comment on that. I just expected to get any comment at all on how I wrote the code and what could have done better regarding best practices.

Now the second reviewer for the second project is telling me I did it completely wrong. They turned off the assignment submit feature on me where I couldn't submit anymore assignments.

I also submitted another assignment by accident that was CLEARLY wrong but it was approved just fine. I contacted Udacity about that too and never received a response.

I was supposed to be done with my course before the 5/25 deadline of being charged again.

So now I have spent hours of my time trying to complete a course and Udacity won't even let me finish to receive my Digital Marketing certificate.

I want a FREE course extension due to the incompetence of their reviewers but I can't even get a response back to my emails.

Don't waste your time and money. This is a scam company.

========================================

After a month of not responding to my emails and forcing me to make this review, this is their response:

Hello Elyse, 

Thanks for writing us back, unfortunately since you have cancelled your subscription for the nanodegree program, we can not offer a project submission extension.

Our apologizes for your experiences with the project review. We take the quality of project reviews seriously, and we are doing all we can to improve our quality. Project Reviewers are a vital part of the student experience and we always want to put forth our best when grading student projects.

I've passed along this information to our team, and we are thankful for your feedback.

All The Best,

Briauna Dotson
Program Coordinator, Services

========================================

My response:

You're not understanding. I would have been done with the nanodegree if it wasn't for your incompetent reviewers. Why should I have had to pay an extra $399 and wait almost a month for you to respond back to me?

It took you 3 weeks just to reset my assignment submission and you didn't even reset the second one I asked about so therefore I would have been paying an extra $800 due to two people's incompetence.",Person,https://user-images.trustpilot.com/5aa547d24de5666d34bf1071/73x73.png,Elyse Robinson,https://uk.trustpilot.com/users/5aa547d24de5666d34bf1071,Thing,Udacity,Organization,Trustpilot,https://uk.trustpilot.com,Rating,1

895,Review,2020-05-18T08:55:25+00:00,It's OK,en,"I have recently completed two Udacity ""nanodegree"" courses: UX Design and Product Management. Here are my thoughts:
Pros:
1. Overall it's a good place to start for a beginner. Each course gave me a better understanding of what the jobs are about (something I couldn't find in short courses from coursera or udemy).  
2. The assignments are good and you have some freedom to choose your own topic in the UX course which is good. Grading is really fast - usually within 24h so you can move through the course quickly. 
3. Both courses took me about two months to complete. I was on the monthly payment plan and therefore motivated to finish them quickly. It's totally possible if you can spare 2-3 hours a day. 
4. Both courses also come with linkedin section where they teach you what to improve and give feedback on your edits. The UX course also teaches how to prepare case studies for your portfolio which I found really useful. 
5. There is a community around each course and each section has a micro-forum where you can ask questions if you're stuck. 

CONS:
1. Instructors. The course is structured in a typical way where you watch videos of your tutor speaking, then do a short quiz (not mandatory) and go to the next section. Instructors vary between course sections which makes it interesting. That being said some of the instructors are very poor. There are two instructors whose English is poor so they may be difficult to understand especially for a non-native speaker when even subtitles are incorrect. Some of the tutors seem to have the knowledge but not any presentation skills so getting through certain lessons was a real struggle. Some instructors made mistakes which were then marked on the video and I found that a bit lazy on the Udacity's side. Overall out of maybe 10 instructors, only 2 were engaging. 

2. Price. I took the advantage of their discounted monthly plan but if I'd paid over £800 per course I would have been very dissapointed due to poor delivery of the content. 

3. Navigation. The side navigation is a bit confusing at times and it's not possible to ""untick"" lessons as you go so I often found myself skipping lessons accidentaly. 

4. Feedback feels robotic. I have asked specific questions with my linkedin submission but the person never got back to me about those. This is also true for the assignments. They are graded fast but more of a copy-paste ""great job, you have done xyz correctly!"". I'd appreciate more personalised feedback. 

5. The whole ""nanodegree"" concept is just a maketing catchword that you should be aware of (in case you're not). It's got nothing to do with a degree, it's just a course but it's not even accredited. You get a PDF certificate but that's about it. I'm afraid it may be misleading to some. 

Hope this honest review will help you decide if Udacity is something for you. They have a free monthly trial now so you can always give it a go and see how you feel.",Person,https://user-images.trustpilot.com/5590e8b70000ff0001c91a9f/73x73.png,Clee,https://uk.trustpilot.com/users/5590e8b70000ff0001c91a9f,Thing,Udacity,Organization,Trustpilot,https://uk.trustpilot.com,Rating,3

It's my first time with Udacity , and i believe it will not be the last time. The website is well organized , the project was helpful , and the reviewer was clear about what should be done and what shouldn't. The materials of the course are perfect; as I'm not a marketing student , but i really do like marketing. Udacity DMND program helped me achieve what i always want.

First, i like the teaching style. Basics --> your own research --> project --> review if necessary.
Unlike many other courses, based only on videos, this program makes you read the documentation and search for answers yourself. I consider these 2 aspects to be very important for a programmer.

Being able to ask good questions is of extreme importance in any field of Development. This program teaches you to ask GOOD questions, to meet the required project specifications.

I want to mention the Udacity's GUI, it looks and feels amazing.

Overall, the program and TA's give us great value and experience. Worth it.",Person,,A M,https://uk.trustpilot.com/users/5ead6d1846f4d041eef8c9a6,Thing,Udacity,Organization,Trustpilot,https://uk.trustpilot.com,Rating,5

I'm from Croatia where the school system is pretty ""old fashion"" and not the most modern. Udacity should be an example of how modern schools should look like in the 21st Century. Udacity pays attention to every single detail in each lesson and the material is made so quality, that you really enjoy learning. On top of everything you have mentor support 24/7 and the student community is great too. I use to take some courses on Udemy, but it's so different than Udacity. Without doing the projects and practicing you have learned, you didn't do really too much to improve your skills. In my opinion, video, text and quiz content + projects make a great combination together.

1075,Review,2020-04-15T14:56:21+00:00,Best UX course,en,"I was looking around for over a month trying to decide which UX online course would suit me. I have 10 years of experience in this field so I wanted a course that could take me throughout an industry realistic process and it would help me fill the gaps. And that's exactly what I got from it. The curriculum is split in half between theory and hands-on exercises and gradually it exposes you to more difficult lessons and exercises. Everything a UX designer should know is covered, even more importantly, you know how everything connects.

One thing to keep in mind is that lessons don't contain as much in-depth content as a senior should know but that's a good thing because UX is a deep field and one might lose his interest. Instead, you gain a complete overview of everything and you can dig deeper afterwards.

You leave feeling prepared to work in the industry, unlike like other courses that seem to teach the same old generic BS lessons you can read for free on Medium.",Person,,Folea Emanuel,https://uk.trustpilot.com/users/5e97208b31f34ec943f0e39c,Thing,Udacity,Organization,Trustpilot,https://uk.trustpilot.com,Rating,5

1087,Review,2020-04-14T06:35:50+00:00,A moment for a 5-star review: iOS Nanodegree Program over a 30-day trial period,en,"This is a wonderful program in terms of its contents and instructional style. The materials are comprehensive, well-organized, and most importantly, make up a fun learning journey. The in-class exercises are very helpful and tie well with the projects required by the core curriculum. Most video lectures are short and accompanied by instructors' notes (or articles) that are easy to read and follow. 

Prior to enrolling in this program, I have had experience in Android programming as well as both recent academic and industry internship experience in data science. I would say, despite my extensive computational background, this course still challenged me and taught me transferrable skills through the Swift-iOS framework. For the 3 of 5 curriclum projects that I have submitted so far, I received constructive feedback from Udacity mentors. My Udacity reviewers really kept their expectations high and pushed for high-quality code + product. 

A few critiques for the sake of completeness: a few places where multiple sample apps are introduced and intertwined (e.g. UIKit & Networking lessons), it was a bit difficult to follow. Also, there seems to be some inconsistency in whether external links (e.g. GitHub repo, API websites, Apple Developer documentation) were provided. Nevertheless, these issues are rather minor, and I was able to digest the material by watching the lecture videos and associated notes more than once. 

Last but not least, I really appreciate Udacity's free 30-day trial period in the COVID-19 time when #stayhome is the best option for all. I only wish the program could be more affordable so that I could move along at a slower pace. Though it has been a ""sprint"" for me to get the most out of this nanodegree, this program has taught me quite a lot. Thus, I want give a moment to leave this program a 5-star review.",Person,,David C,https://uk.trustpilot.com/users/5e9559b894af7ec41bc17f90,Thing,Udacity,Organization,Trustpilot,https://uk.trustpilot.com,Rating,5

1373,Review,2019-12-13T19:23:17+00:00,Your policy needs to be more empathetic,en,"Udacity's big promise is to offer people eager to learn an opportunity.

In short, and to make this brief – I am a paid customer to this moment, a brief incident happened with the payment while stopping the subscription for a certain course and subscribing for a new course.

While I was eager to start my new course, due to this incident, I lost access to the very last 1 week worth of learning of my previous course.

I asked the folks at Udacity if they can re-open up the older course for one or two weeks till I have the chance to finish that last part – They have asked me to renew the older course for 4 months (another 400+ Euros). I have paid over 900 Euros in total so far. All I got is that standard corporate, non-empathetic response of ""Sorry, we can not help you, you must pay us more.""

The question is, are you certain you can't really help a student here?

You, Udacity, obviously can help here, what harm will it bring to Udacity from re-opening a course for a student who is actually ""still"" paying you for just a couple weeks? I think your policy in place surely forgot that Udacity is about helping people learn. Be flexible with your students, and most importantly be flexible and helpful to your paid loyal customers.

You can surely help simply because re-opening will do you 0% harm in terms of costs you accrue. This is not a direct pricing relationship between computing power cost & usage. This is a relationship between content that's already prepared, and consumed by hundreds or thousands of students on a daily basis, therefore, it will never be of a harm to you.

Having finished the course, I find I have learned a lot more:
•	Python (in-depth), 
•	Ndarrays, etc. using NumPy,
•	DataFrames, etc. using Pandas, 
•	Working with many other NoSQL structures
•	A more powerful SQL language: PostgreSQL
•	Unix Shell commands
•	Git

Perhaps even more importantly (and unexpectedly), I learned a bunch of really useful techniques to use in the coding world such as:
•	How to routinely work with other contributors using Git and GitHub, 
•	Using a Shell terminal with Git Bash and Anaconda packages,
•	Using code editors: Atom and Visual Studio Code, 
•	Using program output to feed Excel charts 
•	Using Excel charts to make compelling Powerpoint slides,
•	Adding links to Google and Markdown Docs, 
•	How to preview results in real time when writing Markdown docs, 
•	Creating good README.md files and many other best practices

The projects were well done and very effective in helping me apply the lessons learned in the course.  I especially appreciated the Python project using just under a million real-life records of bikeshare usage data.  After looking back and thinking about what I learned, to say that I highly recommend this course would be an understatement!

But I request my refund and cancellation to both Sherry and Pritha before the 7 day deadline. This entire company is a scam, and all they want is your money. They ignore your refund requests and instead, they reply with “we will cancel future payments”. I purchased this on Oct 18. I requested the refund Oct 22 (WAY BEFORE THE 7 DAY DEADLINE), upon which PRITHA ignored my request and told me to cancel instead. I cancelled on Oct 25 AND I ALSO requested my refund of $899 FOR THE SECOND TIME, because I didn’t just want the request for cancellation which would disable future payments; RATHER I WANTED MY $899 REFUND OF THE FULL AMOUNT. Then, Sherry replied Oct 28, that I would not be charged further because the cancellation was approved BUT SHE STILL IGNORED MY REFUND REQUEST. I have ASKED FOR A REFUND OF $899 SINCE OCT 22 WHICH WAS BEFORE THE 7 DAY DEADLINE!!!!! I have electronic evidence of this, and now they’re continuing to ignore me after my 3rd request. I’ve left multiple voicemails yesterday, but their phone line goes straight to a voicemail and they never call back. their customer service purposefully will ignore you and delay the refund request until it’s past the deadline. I didn’t ask for just a cancellation like Sherry or Pritha suggested. Your support advisers are never listened to me, and they treat their customers with disrespect. I asked for a refund of the $899 amount, because it was purchased this on accident. I have not used the services AT ALL or account OR ANYTHING, and I requested the refund well before 7 days but have been constantly avoided or misunderstood by your service reps.",Person,,ester park,https://uk.trustpilot.com/users/5dba11992da78aa62ce7b6c7,Thing,Udacity,Organization,Trustpilot,https://uk.trustpilot.com,Rating,1
