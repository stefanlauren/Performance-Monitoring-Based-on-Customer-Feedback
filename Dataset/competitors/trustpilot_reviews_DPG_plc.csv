1,Review,2021-06-04T16:17:07+00:00,Flexible But Low Quality,en,"Pros:
I chose DPG because of the self-led learning, there are no deadlines and you can work as quickly or slowly as you want. 

Cons:
Course material is outdated and presented through a learning platform that is not modern or engaging. E-Lessons provided often do not seem relevant to the assignment for the module. 

Takes three weeks for assignments to be marked! I had a couple of occasions where this was longer than the three week period as well, which is so disheartening when your assignment is referred and you have to wait another 3+ weeks. 

Lack of support from facilitators and tutors, answers on webinars always very vague and I only found out at the end I was meant to have a personal tutor! They never reached out to check in. Without a Facebook study group I stumbled across I would have no idea how to complete the course! 

Wouldn't study again with DPG.",Person,,Zoe S,https://uk.trustpilot.com/users/5b71982d4de5666d34e1b309,Thing,DPG,Organization,Trustpilot,https://uk.trustpilot.com,Rating,2

4,Review,2021-06-01T13:36:05+00:00,bad admin and poor course material lets it down.,en,"Where do I begin! I have just completed my Level 7 with DPG (3 year prior I had completed my L5 with them also so I have had a the full experience). this feedback relates to my L7:
General admin of the course extremely poor 
1) the log in details I got from day one didn't work and it took weeks to get this sorted, in fact it was me who suggested could it be because I had done L5 and there might be a duplication.
2) I had to follow up numerous times to get the details of course dates and locations
3) once I was even sent to the wrong location (and I later heard it wasn't just me who had this experience).
4) having picked my modules at the start of the course I was then told at the start of  my y2 to rebook, when I did I was told the London dates were now full. Only after kicking up a fuss (because 1 why ask us at the start and then do nothing and if you don't tell us we need to do this why would we!) did they book me onto London dates.
5) on almost all of the occasions prior to attending the training days I had to chase up for the online modules to be added to my profile.
6) all of the course material was extremely out of date, it hadn't been updated for over 6 years and very often in the classes we were told to ignore a lot of the content.
7) this is a personal view - I felt the exam prep workdays were not very helpful. They were light and lacked support and preparation with how to answer the questions. Often we were told to read the past papers but they did not give you actual examples of what a good answer looked like or was structured. 
8) When I finally came to get my qualification my maiden name was given to CIPD, this caused a 3 month delay in getting my certificate and again something i had to sort out - this was even after I had told DPG 3 times prior that my name had changed.

On a positive side, I found the tutors in general to be very good. 

Given how the course switched to be online due to covid I was disappointed that DPG offer no refund or reduction for what had been charged as an in person course.",Person,,customer,https://uk.trustpilot.com/users/58e5e83b0000ff000a8a2994,Thing,DPG,Organization,Trustpilot,https://uk.trustpilot.com,Rating,1

The chairman of the Hotel asked me to move from my Financial Controller role to HR as a Group HR Manager–Support Services as part of a restructuring of the HR team. This is where my love for HR started. The pandemic gave me an opportunity to study towards my CIPD. I chose to study with DPG  and the guidance I received was brilliant - access to their platforms, community and tutors. I finished my course in 9 months with a break of one month. I have also managed to find a role in HR.

10,Review,2021-04-16T19:32:10+00:00,Poor quality learning,en,"Online learning is poor quality. The Advanced qualifications consist of 4 short e-learning modules with poor quality references and citations (even though it’s stressed to do further reading). Activities consist of a handful of downloadable documents branded with ICS Learning, templates quoted in e-learning are not available on the platform and no further reading resources are sign posted, other than list of books (which you have to buy yourself). Facilitators prompt discussions in group forums but no one actually responds - this indicates how engaging it actually is. One webinar per module is offered, which effectively is used as Q&A on how to pass an assignment rather than gaining knowledge and understanding about the subject. I raised my concerns and I effectively was told to leave the programme by the customer experience team. Given the hype around new CIPD qualification, my recommendation is go somewhere else as DPG has clearly struggled to keep up with the change.",Person,,Daniel Cooper,https://uk.trustpilot.com/users/6079e5cd3dda49001aeeeb28,Thing,DPG,Organization,Trustpilot,https://uk.trustpilot.com,Rating,1

With DPG, I was able to pay over several months and start at my convenience without any pressure to finish at a certain time, you are given 2 years if need be to complete and it's up to you to choose your pace depending on what life throws at you.

Once you start you have several tools in place to help you along the way: 
-The e-lessons (where all the content is thought, quizzed and referenced)
- The briefs are then provided (where you are explained thoroughly what is expected)
- The community pages (where you can find guidance to obstacles)
- The Webinars (where you can ask your questions live, which are recorded for other students to watch later)
- You then submit your assessment online and get marked within 3 weeks which I think is completely reasonable.
With even more supporting tools in place, it's really easy to navigate through the assessments and get unstuck, manage your workload and plan your own study. 

I couldn't recommend DPG enough, the assessors have all the patience in the world and always there to help.
If you're comparing all the providers (like I did quite thoroughly) then do consider DPG as they really are specialists in the field, care about what they do and not just after your money.",Person,https://user-images.trustpilot.com/5a8a6c01f675864e56040f43/73x73.png,Marie Favre,https://uk.trustpilot.com/users/5a8a6c01f675864e56040f43,Thing,DPG,Organization,Trustpilot,https://uk.trustpilot.com,Rating,5

First, if it weren't for the super special price and great payment conditions, I don't know when it would be possible to take this course. I was researching with a DPG competitor (ICS Learn) and, when I asked if he could get a better discount, the attendant said to look for another company because they would never give a better discount than that but it was the best thing that happened to me. Unlike the competitor ICS, the service at DPG was first class. Super fast, efficient return, Roderick was super patient and clarified all my doubts and always presented solutions to all obstacles. I am very excited and looking forwards to start my CIPD qualification.
In these times of uncertainty, this course was all I needed to try to get a job in such a competitive market during the pandemic.

112,Review,2020-05-27T11:37:02+00:00,I decided to do the CIPD Level 5 in HR,en,"I decided to do the CIPD Level 5 in HR. So far I'm in the second module, it has been great. They provide a lot of support and based on what I see, they try to always apply the theory to practical examples. So the idea is when you finish this course, you actually know how to apply all these to your organisation and it's not just theory learnt. 
In their course, they have some sort of simulation where you can put the theory into HR practice. This was one of the convincing points that I really liked compared to others. 
They are always providing webinars where you can ask questions and the facilitators answer. They are very helpful. I must say that I'm really happy with DPG. 
The only criticism that I have is that assignments can take up to 3 weeks to be corrected. I don't expect assignments to be corrected in a day like ICS is doing, but I'd say a week would be ideal, the reason behind is because once you start with your other module and you are very into the reading material and writing, it's hard to go back to the previous assessment if you have to re-do it. I understand if there is a lot of work but I'd suggest as a business that they can find approaches on how to improve correction time. 
At the moment, based of what I've seen ICS corrects within a day or two and Avado same week, so it'd be really good if DPG could nearly match their competitors. 

Having said that, I'd definitely recommend DPG. Facilitators are really good, professionals and always trying to give practical examples so that you understand.",Person,https://user-images.trustpilot.com/579f2b4c0000ff000a36ab0a/73x73.png,Gabriela Menendez,https://uk.trustpilot.com/users/579f2b4c0000ff000a36ab0a,Thing,DPG,Organization,Trustpilot,https://uk.trustpilot.com,Rating,4

I panicked and advised the gentleman who had sent the email as the course hadn’t yet started, he advised... don’t worry about it there will be plenty of other dates for you to attend just let us know on your induction. So I did this, however I am now advised that I will need to attend the workshop in London.. which will cost me an extra £150-£200 for travel and a hotel stay as the workshop is for 2 days...

174,Review,2020-02-18T23:04:17+00:00,Good course,en,"I submitted my last assignment as well as my reflective blog last week so I have now completed the CIPD Level 5 Diploma in HR Management. 

I thoroughly enjoyed the course but struggled a bit with vague answers from the facilitators sometimes when stuck with a question on assignments and also feedback from the assessors when referring on an assignment.  I appreciate they can't just 'give us the answer' but at times I felt like I was back in the 80s on the TV show 321 trying to work out the cryptic clues but ending up with Dusty Bin!!!

As it is 100% online, you can sometimes feel as if you are on your own.  However, I think I may have been in one of the first groups to start the 100% online course as there did not appear to be that many students ahead of us so therefore even less people to ask advice from.  Now, there are lots of people studying online and they help each other which is great to see.  I also tried to help people who were struggling with units I had already passed.

Initially, the briefing videos for each unit were not fantastic, especially for CHR.  Several people did post saying they were struggling and the facilitators redid the videos last July which was great.  Unfortunately, this was after I had struggled through so I found this unit particularly difficult.

One other thing that a lot of us agreed on was the length of time it took to mark assignments.  The assessors have up to 3 weeks but with other providers, they are marked within 5 days.  Perhaps this could be looked at going forward?

I would like to study one unit online at Level 7 (Employment Law).  Unfortunately, DPG do not offer this online but other providers do (cost £923).  I would be looking to start this later in the year so if DPG were to offer this online, I would be very interested.  I will keep my eye out for any changes :)",Person,,Lisa H,https://uk.trustpilot.com/users/5ba409c44de5666d34ddcf85,Thing,DPG,Organization,Trustpilot,https://uk.trustpilot.com,Rating,4

And of course is not a gift you need to pay for it. Once I decided to cancel my course in 8 days after the call, (wasn’t a real enrol) they told me by email (late answer) that I need to pay all the course cos I already log in on my student page, how can try the course if I’m not in their website?

I expressed that my boss have already given the go ahead before going on holiday and that this was a matter of formality before sensing in my forms. I had spoken to my consultant a number of times in the day to keep in touch regarding the progress. I sent off my form later that afternoon and was told all was secured in terms of my place on the programme. I then received an email, no phone call, informing me my application was rejected as the programme was now fully booked and there was no space for me attend the programme. At no point in time did any of the two consults advise that I could loose my place if the paper work was not handed in. Whats the point of a provisional booking if it actually can't book anything? I feel let down and disappointed, that the consultant did not have the courtesy to call me regarding this and felt that an email was good enough! This is a programme that cost well over £4000 and that's how you get treated for the money you are paying. Secondly I had rearranged our own internal training calendar for the year as well as other events in our business to cater for my attendance which I will have to change again based on the July programme workshop dates. Lastly on a personal note, I know have to wait until July to attend the programme which is four months away and now means I only get to qualify at the end of January next year as apposed to October this year. I would still like to attend the March group and feel that I should not have to suffer due to the poor service of the consultants representing your company.",Person,,Peter Van Biljon,https://uk.trustpilot.com/users/5c79270fd1bfb6838a78cfe4,Thing,DPG,Organization,Trustpilot,https://uk.trustpilot.com,Rating,1
