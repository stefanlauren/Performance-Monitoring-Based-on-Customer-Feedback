I'd always thought that bootcamps were a nice idea for getting a very basic level of competence, but were pretty pricey for the privilege for what you could get from an online course.

So I was pleasantly surprised at how effective this teaching style was for ramping up students from basically knowing nothing about coding to being a hireable junior developer.
