0,Review,2021-06-02T20:22:21+00:00,"World-class universities, but mediocre support and poorly designed website",en,"I've completed several classes with edX. The content of the courses was excellent, but there are some serious flaws with the website and the support team that leads to a poor user experience for learners. This experience means it will be unlikely I will purchase any future courses from them.

First, the website is simply not designed well:
- It's difficult to browse for new course titles. 
- You cannot save courses for later. 
- The ""Dashboard"" lists all of the courses you've taken, regardless of whether the course was completed. If you un-enroll from a course, it won't appear on the Dashboard, but you cannot take it the course again until the next ""session"" or if you pay (maybe).
- Courses cannot be archived.
- If you complete a course, you cannot share achievement page that shows up after finishing the course.
- There is also no link to the main course page, where you originally enrolled.

Another website flaw is that after a course has expired, you can no longer view the home screen for that course. The home screen is the page you go after enrolling. That page has all the dates you need to know for the course, so if you no longer have access, you cannot get the dates. The problem here is that although a course has expired, there is still time to upgrade to a verified certificate. But since each course has its own deadline, you need to access the home screen for each course to learn this information. 

The support staff leaves a lot to be desired. In my case, I took a few classes but did not upgrade while I considered if it was worth the money, which is/was limited. Eventually, the course expired, but the website still gave me the option to upgrade. I wanted to know how much time I had left to consider my options, before my access to upgrade would expire, but the site does not provide dates for when this post-course/pre-upgrade period ends. So I contacted their support team to learn how I could find out when my course would expire. After submitting my question, I had a 14+ email exchange with someone on their support who repeatedly told me I could ""upgrade to the verified track by paying the fee"" or enroll in the the next session. At one point, they said I could view the course's homepage to find this information. But when I asked for an explanation on how to view the course homepage after my access to a course has expired, they support staff began sending progressively worse messages. Instead of addressing their own suggestion, they simply copied and pasted responses from their FAQ, no regard to how well the response actually answered my question. They even left a final message that was literally an overview of how edX works, ""edX is a non-profit massive open online course provider...."" Condescending, in other words. There is still no date available on the dashboard, which would answer my question. It's basic sales psychology. The least they could say is, ""Sorry that feature isn't available right now"", or something remotely helpful along those lines. 

My conclusion is that when their support staff cannot answer the question, they've been given orders to not provide answers outside of a narrow set of responses, regardless of how well the response provides value or a solution. 

The other thing that doesn't make sense is their enrollment/expiration policy. For instance, un-enrolling from a course means you cannot re-enroll until the course is offered again. However, when you view a course's overview page (found after searching), it will show you that the course begins on whatever date is today. But, if you go to your Dashboard, you will see no record of having ever taken the course. There are other issues I could go into, but those are some of the main errors I've seen. 

It's a shame some really world-class universities are associated with a mediocre support team and poorly designed website. The content is really fantastic, but dealing with the website and the support team is very challenging.",Person,,Allison,https://uk.trustpilot.com/users/60b7e86b9110c3001a8e767b,Thing,edX,Organization,Trustpilot,https://uk.trustpilot.com,Rating,1
1,Review,2021-05-28T16:52:05+00:00,Thin unstructured content and tech not working,en,"The courses: 
I have done a course with Harvard  and one with Smithsonian. 
Both times the content was thin and unstructured.
I have seen more professional content by some YouTubers than I have on these courses.
The study time estimates are a complete joke: one course had 7 hrs to 35 hrs study (in itself not very helpful). Would you believe it had 60 hours of film to watch, 20 recommended books and 15 assignments to submit? Did I mention you had to have a blog or create a website for it and do social media posting at every step? More like 100 hours of work minimum.

The platform:
- The tech is at best tedious and at worse not working at all.
- Moving from one page to another takes time and it is the only way to get an overview of the course (to gage your study time).
- Some parts of the course are missing from the syllabus and will only appear as you progress (too bad if you are approaching the deadline)
- For some courses, the units will not mark as complete (even if you have done all the work and submitted 5 times). If you get in touch with the helpdesk, they respond ""it will not affect you, the teacher doesn't look at that""... then you check their FAQ and see that that it is totally the opposite: because your units aren't showing as complete you are not going to get graded at all.
Then you check Trustpilot and see that other's work never got graded and people never got their certificate, despite contacting the helpdesk AND the relevant university.
After a second ticket raised with the helpdesk and 10 emails, i'm still trying to get the entirety of my work graded.

Essentially these courses are a Windows of marketing for the universities and institutions on the platform. They'll even use you to do loads of social media posting for them as mandatory to submit your coursework.
If all you want is a certificate from a prestigious institution (and you are lucky with the technology and are unconcerned about learning or being treated as a human by the helpdesk), then this platform may be for you.
If you are serious about learning and would like some respect, it is not.",Person,,Maud,https://uk.trustpilot.com/users/56d989b30000ff000a0bb8e3,Thing,edX,Organization,Trustpilot,https://uk.trustpilot.com,Rating,1
2,Review,2021-05-05T20:21:33+00:00,Very unreasonable,en,"I added an extra star for the effort the teachers went through to record the lecture videos, because the visuals help with learning the concepts. But that's about where it ends. 
This was my second attempt at completing a particular course (free version) relevant to my current university studies. During the first attempt, I admittedly didn't manage my time well, and I only completed 3 of the 6 weeks before I lost my access to the course. I was bummed but I moved on. Months later, I see the same course has become available again. I had to start from scratch and do all the tests again from week 1 (I want to achieve a passing grade). I knew the due date was 3 May, so I worked hard to get to the end of the course this time. As I logged on for what I planned to be my last session just before 8am on 3 May, I found I no longer had access. Apparently EdX (in contrast to the rest of the world) defines a 3 May closing date as a ""midnight on 2 May"" due date. This is no doubt part of their plan to force people to buy the (very overpriced) 'verified certificate', because it's the only way we won't lose all our progress, and most people do use that last day to complete these online courses. 
I'm so frustrated. I've poured HOURS of valuable time into this course (3 'weeks' the first time and 5 'weeks' the second time) and I have squat to show for it. Not even the meaningless free certificate. I emailed the support and begged to give me just two more hours of access, since their due date was very misleading. They said no of course. Then I applied for the financial support to pay for the verified certificate, which they rejected.
I wouldn't recommend EdX to anyone. I have completed free and verified courses on Coursera and I haven't had any issues.",Person,,Nadia,https://uk.trustpilot.com/users/605dc5ce2f9b2c00197d490b,Thing,edX,Organization,Trustpilot,https://uk.trustpilot.com,Rating,2

It is advisable to avoid this edX. 

As you can see from these comments on Trustpilot, there has been no effort from edX to even address any of these comments listed, which shows you no care for its audience.

I signed up for a course which I thought would be enjoyable as these courses are not accreditable at all so the level of knowledge should not be of a degree or up, however, the teacher mark paper-based on THEIR level rather than the students level. 

In the end, these courses are mostly marked by other students which are not knowledgeable in the background of the course topic. They are the ones which grade you. 

There is supposedly a teacher who looks over your course work but I think they are robots as the feedback was the same from the student. 

There is no resubmission either, you cant talk to any teachers for support and the admin is a nightmare. 

Their response is about as fast as a snail.

The admins also are not educated nor trained on the course so they say something which they THINK is right but is not.

The journey with edX is so stressful, rather than enjoyable and a lot of it is very misleading as well only when you come out to the end do you find out. 

While the course might look appealing, my suggestion is to go straight to the Uni themselves and do the course there.",Person,,P.B,https://uk.trustpilot.com/users/55c2f8c00000ff0001d207be,Thing,edX,Organization,Trustpilot,https://uk.trustpilot.com,Rating,1

In addition, other learning platforms allow learners to reset missed deadlines to receive a certification.  However, edX's policy of completing all assignments by the course date for a certificate is a money-making scheme.

There is no any hands-on practice, no any useful videos. There are videos on the background of C++, how it evolved, what has changed from the previous versions and so on. Crap who needs this???
 
ID verification process is terrible:

My ID verification has failed 4 times so far, because the system only allows to take a selfie shots. No attachments or front camera options enabled. What a poor service and very bad user experience!

Conclusion:
Overall, I have got nothing but stress from edX. I lost the followings:

I learned more there with great professors than during my master's degree in my Belgian university, where a lot of time was waisted attending the course, being present. Here with edX, at midnight or at the airport, in a train, in the car you can listen the clases. Also you feel taking part of a beautiful multidiverse community. You share more afterwards with events and seminars, meeting those wonderful and nice persons, those fantastic professors with their leadership competences and who make you meet their environment, and other people.
It is so great that posibility of micromaster or even MBA online for people like me who doesn't want to waste time but who want to be a continued learner. 
My courses were Business leadership from UQueensland and Sciences of Happiness at work BerkeleyUC, also Data analysis. 
Such amazing experience I won't forget !",Person,,Laurence De Raet,https://uk.trustpilot.com/users/5e32bab2ddcefa29d861d64f,Thing,edX,Organization,Trustpilot,https://uk.trustpilot.com,Rating,4

Regarding edX itself, the materials and videos are mostly very good. But I would recommend improving the QA forum sections a bit. Also, the upload system for hand-in assignments should be improved. For example, it is said to upload multiple files in the assignment, but you can only upload one single file, for what you need to choose a zip format. Either improve towards using zips as standardized containers for hand-ins or make it possible to upload multiple files. 

Nevertheless, I really enjoy edX and would like to see a growing catalog of subjects especially in the professional certificate section (e.g. Communication Technology) or the micro-master section. Because a series of courses always stands out from a single encounter.

To the edX Team, keep it going. This is a great project and only by knowledge humanity can advance.

Courses were launched before they were ready, some were half-finished as a result, others were delayed months, (including the tightly-deadlined capstone project), causing major disruption to learners. 

TAs were unresponsive on the message board, and assessments had major errors in the grading system, and didn't account for very differences between R installations that might result in (statistically) immaterial differences in expected answers. As far as the video lectures, it was apparent that Dr. Irrizarry was reading off a teleprompter and not fully engaged with what he was saying, with awkward intonation and emphasis, and not fully utilizing the visual medium. The course had inconsistent expectations of learners' understanding of statistics and calculus, sometimes explaining concepts very basically, and at other times glossing over graduate-level concepts.

Some courses had major swings in complexity. Data Wrangling could be done in an afternoon, while Machine Learning could easily take days or weeks. The capstone project was poorly scoped, and inconsistently graded.

edX was only too happy to take my money upfront though.

Ultimately, I learned a lot and feel the professional certificate is valuable, and I have no problem working hard to learn a new concept. But it felt like I spent more time fighting poor course design than than I was investing in my learning.

Lesson learned: don't take (or at least don't pay for) a professional certificate course the first year it is offered.",Person,,edX Learner,https://uk.trustpilot.com/users/5df41a1b815b04fe12764e9a,Thing,edX,Organization,Trustpilot,https://uk.trustpilot.com,Rating,3

I took the R modules (you could choose Azure ML or Python as an alternative).
The only little downside was that, after the R introduction, the remainder of the track expected deeper R knowledge than already taught, and had to resort to external sources to properly understand more complex R stuff to move on.

180,Review,2019-12-08T01:54:56+00:00,I love the edX learning environment,en,"I love the edX learning environment.  LOTS of choices.  I can find a course on whatever interests me.  My only niggle is that sometimes (speaking specifically about so Microsoft offerings) the course material has not kept up with the application.  This causes students to have to figure out what the instructor(s) are talking about to arrive at the correct answer or use a process.  Another thing.  In one instance, I felt that the curriculum failed miserably at preparing me for the final in the course.  For example, the course labs were kind of fill in the blank, fairly easy, and were not comprehensive.  The final in the course asked LOTS of stuff that I was not prepared to answer.  I'll take the blame on this as it's up to me as a student to look beyond the basics.  That said, some sort of a ""the final may be much more difficult than the labs"" disclaimer might be a good idea.  Overall, even in spite of being humbled by the last final, I have learned much and am actively using the material in my professional life.  I'll be back for more learning once I finish some offline learning that I am working on independently.  Cheers and thanks for the great courses!

The classes I've been taking have been great for me, but I do think they would have been very rough for a lot of people without my background and I don't think that was the way it was sold. They were full of great content, they really were, but they could have been a little more diverse. I know seeing the same (slightly enhanced) example across multiple weeks and even multiple courses seemed redundant at times.

I did well, but I also thought the test banks were a little unfair because there were frequent situations where multiple answers could be correct or it would be a true/false question without a lot of detail, but would also use words like ""precisely"" and you can't help but think its a trick.

Bottom line, I got a lot out of taking the W3C course on edX and I signed up for a lot more after I finished, but I do question whether it would be right for the masses.",Person,,Joshua,https://uk.trustpilot.com/users/58328b4c0000ff000a594a6b,Thing,edX,Organization,Trustpilot,https://uk.trustpilot.com,Rating,4

Today, edX has the power to shape a new standard of education, lifelong learning, and professional development. And, while doing so, delivering a service that affects learners at a societal scale. In the future, their efforts could shift towards adding incentives for high-disparity, low-income, and PPP-deficient nations. If well implemented, these emerging and developing economies stand to benefit the most from wide access to quality education.

Knowingly, in some cases, edX already offers financial aid. However, the issue can sometimes be cultural!

For the course I took, the course content was poorly delivered, but that's not on them.

The third party platform they use for grading didn't accept correct responses but that's also not on them.

What is on them is having arbitrary deadlines to complete paid for, self-paced online work, giving no warning when the time is about to expire, and then forcing students to pay for the course again to complete them. Not cheap either when compared to the same types of courses offered on other platforms ($99 for a SQL course, when a higher caliber one is available through Udemy for $10.)

No phone number to contact so you have to go back and forth via email to discuss issues, and each response takes at least a day if not more. 

Overall, I'll complete the current courses I'm enrolled in, never spend money on them again, and will tell anyone who asks to avoid. To say the behaviour is unacceptable is a gross understatement.

Edit: a rep from EdX replied below, but I dont believe his response addresses the bulk of the issue: comparatively overpriced courses with arbitrary deadlines, poor quality customer support without option to call and no level of proactivity in their simplistic ""the deadline passed (no other info on next steps)"" responses, having to redo all of the course content if you miss said deadline, etc.

I've clearly already reached out to the support team, given the content of this review, so the advice to do so again will get me nowhere. Any reader may take this as an example of the caliber of service they can expect from this platform.",Person,,Ela G,https://uk.trustpilot.com/users/539b58400000640001793b34,Thing,edX,Organization,Trustpilot,https://uk.trustpilot.com,Rating,1

This is a major problem because EDX got their time stamp of the modules to end in October 2019. How can they allow people to register for 10 modules in September and then deny them the opportunity to progress. Mind you this is not cheap $1100. It was clearly stated that the program will end in December and all modules will have to be completed. I tried to contact Edx and they don't respond.

But when you face similar problem, EdX would say it's your own fault and suggest that you should finish the assignment as soon as possible. As previous reviewers mentioned, the EdX Support was terrible, just keep saying your assignment score could be dropped (which was not the case for me and took a significant portion of the total grade) and would never assume the responsibility by fixing the issue for you, but instead keep saying something else without any intention to offer help.

The platform is really good. Depending on the courses you have different options in terms of how the lectures are released and how knowledge is tested. For now I always purchase the option of obtaining the certificates and there are several ways to test your knowledge (final proctored exams, multiple choice quizzes, etc)
The ONLY thing that should be fixed is the proctored exam with Apple Macs running Yosemite OS. It is about time it is fixed and one can take the proctored exam with the latest release of Apple OS.

THE GOOD
1.your course content and selection is excellent and I am a big fan of your micromaster programs and have recently completed two of them (digital leaderships, digital product management) and am currently working on a third one (data science)
2.I like that you introduced some flexibility around course registration and start dates
3.I love the course certificates that can be earned and associated with my linkedin profile. these are great.
4.In general, the course prices are reasonable and are worth the educational value received.
5.I am a big fan of MOOCS and believe that they are a great tool for lifelong learning


THE BAD

Edx refuses to look for solution, you have to deal with the software provider directly, 
You can forget it, because it is not their business to look for solution, all they do is to read for you the manual. 
All in all, you will be treated like an imbecile. 
Edx, you definitely lost me as a paid customer, and this review is only the first one in the social networks.

I am very happy about the lectures and additional material provided. It was a lot of important information that more people should know about. I like that you can also take the courses for free, if you don’t have the funds but simply want to learn something :)

Unfortunately this is the official provider of a course that I want to complete and there are no other options available. I am now 8 units in and have faced multiple issues with the course content being incompatible with environments that they have issued. 

Contacting EDX results in ""we can't help you, ask others taking the course or fix it yourself and if you go past our quarterly mandated renewal window you will have to pay another $99"". Not sure why they have to re-issue the course every 3 months given that all materials are the same again, think it may have something to do with it costing $99 each time(!)

I would not recommend this provider to anyone, I wish I did not have to use them myself.

So the registrations suddenly closed at 15:00UTC with no prior notification. I find them quite unprofessional, they don't respect us as customers and they expose the Universities that use them.

735,Review,2018-12-04T09:39:06+00:00,edX forever!,en,"edX is truly an awesome platform for engaging in lifelong learning.
Right from the sheer range of subjects and topics, to the superb quality and caliber of both the course contents and the institutions offering the the courses – truly a boon. 
What they've achieved, in addition to making fantastic learning resources globally accessible, in many ways has redefined the education in itself, whether one seeks enrichment for the sheer curiosity and pursuit of knowledge, or as a means to build a professional/academic path. Personally, I am moving across disciplines and consequently there are gaps in my understanding and competence in certain areas. I have found edX and the very many hosted courses to be invaluable in filling out these blind spots, enabling a deeper appreciation of the disciplines involved. I have gained more structured knowledge efficiently and along with it, confidence, than I would have if I had relied only on books. 
Most courses that I have taken have far exceeded my expectations, some more so than others. One can easily experience the joy of learning in whichever domain one fancies! Even if there ever were moments of dissatisfaction, they were addressed by either the platform or by the course makers or the discussion groups. 
The very fact that all courses on the platform are open to everyone regardless of financial investments – speaks volumes about edX's commitment to the cause.
Thank you for existing and please don't ever stop!",Person,,Pranay,https://uk.trustpilot.com/users/5c064b394504d8a73cfe4efe,Thing,edX,Organization,Trustpilot,https://uk.trustpilot.com,Rating,5

Compared to other portals, sometimes its not as appealing as other sites e.g. when it comes to interactive coding in a dedicated area of the page (like in codecademy, etc.). edX does not provide this.
Let me point out, that this is not meant to be a con. At some point I appreaciate this behaviour, as the overall learning experience is close to a university, rather than to a ""hands on"" tutorial page.

It is just something you have to keep in mind, work is primarily done in your environment, rather than in an interactive shell.",Person,,Gee,https://uk.trustpilot.com/users/5c06343d9d3a4b87c7009ed7,Thing,edX,Organization,Trustpilot,https://uk.trustpilot.com,Rating,5

However, there have been serious issues with several courses I have taken, and I also disapprove of many emails I have received.

Multiple courses have major automatic grading issues, especially regarding specific answer input format that is not specified in the question. Sometimes question wording is an issue. Some TAs have gone as far as to apologize on the message board to those who mentioned the issue, then say they will specifically review that person's answer and adjust the grade, but that person may be one of hundreds with the same issue and it is not fair to change one person's grade while not touching the faulty grader code and not revisiting every single person's answer that was correct but falsely rejected (obviously not feasible and thus extra unfair to fix one person only).

There is also very, very little staff/community TA support on message boards for most courses I have taken. I just signed up to be a community TA for a future version of the course, and understand now this may be because the contract I had to sign discouraged interaction on the message board on order to force the learner community to be self-sustaining. While understandable, this is NOT reasonable when many issues are beyond learner comprehension level or involve structural issues with the course (such as grader complaints or unclear question wording).",Person,,Amy,https://uk.trustpilot.com/users/5c05813f59b6243da70d2cfd,Thing,edX,Organization,Trustpilot,https://uk.trustpilot.com,Rating,3

We're now in November and the current (not the last) course on the track is being released in bits. The final course may not be released this year and the current may actually expire without being fully released - meaning no qualification!

This is a QUALIFICATION!!! I paid for a qualification which is supposed to help me start a new career with the promise of it taking 4 months tops. Now it may take over a year!?!?

However, their support seems so bad that someone really asked me to ""change my internet service"" after I provided technical screenshots and information :(.

I read this on the night of the 8th while stopped on a long 8 hour drive to see my family. I thought, “Great! I’ll upgrade tomorrow when I get there.” When I signed in the next day to upgrade, I was no longer given the option to do so. I immediately reached out to support via email and Facebook. The edX Facebook account just sends back an automated reply over and over again, and the support team told me there was nothing they could do and to keep my eye on future UX series. Really? I’m not going to spend more money on being treated the same way again in the future and wasting 400 dollars.

The class itself was fine but the system EdX uses  is awful and clunky. If I saw any indication that I would not pass, I would have remedied that. Progress page doesn’t show final portfolio grade so had no reason to think I wouldn’t pass. I see some of my self-reports did not register in the system and I have proof I did them. Customer Serviice was NOT helpful — was told sorry, you didn’t pass, you will need to retake. Did not bother to answer my follow up questions. Glitchy system and horrible interface.
