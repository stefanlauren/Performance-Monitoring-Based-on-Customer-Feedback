On May 8th I was offered free ""Learning"" but never took up this offer. Today I was told that LinkedIn Ireland had taken £24.98 from me by PayPal. Since my so called and unwanted ""Free Trial "" ended today I tried to contact LinkedIn Ireland to cancel further payments and recover my money. As you might already know, however, none of the contact details for LinkedIn  work.  This includes their Dublin phone number. I am surprised that LinkedIn has degenerated to the extent that it now resorts to scamming the elderly. As you will note from other TrustPilot reviews, unlike other more reputable companies, LinkedIn never reply to complaints, so I am not hopeful.",Person,,Colin Brown,https://uk.trustpilot.com/users/53ce2ab70000640001803bad,Thing,Linkedin,Organization,Trustpilot,https://uk.trustpilot.com,Rating,1

Feels like a scam: not even a thank you email after getting a new payment from you. The only way to see the transactions is to check the back account. Very unusual way to treat paying customers.

Sure, why not get money from the people who aren't using the premium account but already have one.

If you want to cancel the already paid premium service - you lose all paid features and recover nothing.

To be honest - the worst paid subscription model I have ever meet. I will avoid any LinkedIn paid service from now on like the plague.",Person,,Victor,https://uk.trustpilot.com/users/591ab9680000ff000a98bc85,Thing,Linkedin,Organization,Trustpilot,https://uk.trustpilot.com,Rating,1

Most important features is CV tool. Make it short and clear. Focus on skills, request skills endorsements and recommendations.  THIS GOT ME MANY JOBS!!!.  Even if you apply in other job-boards, i.e. indeed, cv library, always provide  your LinkedIn page, so they realise you are endorsed and recommended.  Also connect with many colleges with similar roles and exchange in intelligent STORIES that can a) attract comments of experts with similar roles b) most importantly when recruiters see your cv they will realise you CAN EN-LIGHT THE EXPERTS!!!, and your are fully endorsed and recommended.

In my experience the revenue-model of Linkedin has changed into a no “matter what” revenue-model.  At the moment they are also violating the OPT-IN rules by sending newsletters which I did not ask for and they did not ask for permission. So they are working illegal now.

Two months ago, I would have said it was Facebook with a business bias - i.e. not at all good.
Now, it is abysmal. I would say I get about 99.9% unwanted drivel - such as videos of someone skateboarding down a road.
I have ""unfollowed"" so many people, but still get such drivel.
Of the remaining 0.1%, 99% of that is advertising, and I see once in a while an interesting article.
If most of LinkedIn was vaguely relevant, I would be singing its praises, instead it is a waste of time.
I ignore ALL the adverts, because none are relevant. LinkedIn wants me to pay to remove the ads. If LinkedIn wants me to pay for it, provide 99.9% decent content, with some relevant ads, and I might want to pay a small sum to remove the ads. But if I removed the ads, I am still faced with 99.9% drivel.
Please improve the service before I leave for good. And also, had you had customer service via email, you wouldn't have had this review at this point.",Person,,John,https://uk.trustpilot.com/users/53688b84000064000171be08,Thing,Linkedin,Organization,Trustpilot,https://uk.trustpilot.com,Rating,1

Their customer service is appalling/non-existent. They actually don't have a customer service number you can call but they'll take your money and run!! You're supposed to email a generic address and wait for however long it takes for someone to come back to you (on email only, they won't call you). 

The only time you get to speak to a human being is when they're trying to up-sell you a new and outrageously expensive ""solution"". My company pays for a Recruiter Lite licence to help with talent acquisition activities - I was recently told by someone at LinkedIn that I shouldn't be using it because it wasn't designed for recruitment!! So why is it called Recruiter Lite!? And why were you happy to take my money 12 months ago? Now they're trying to sell us something that's 36 times more expensive!!

9,Review,2020-01-19T12:50:18+00:00,Breach of Contract and unlawful trading…,en,"Breach of Contract and unlawful trading practice.

LinkedIn tricked me into signing up for a free trial of one of their services.  At the time I accepted this, the text on the website assured me that I would be contacted before any payment for this subscription was taken, after the free trial period ended.

Of course I never received any notification, and they just took the money, via PayPal.
LinkedIn's customer support email address, as supplied to PayPal, is unmonitored, which rang alarm bells.
PayPal, unsurprisingly, found in LinkedIn's favour and would not refund the payment.
LinkedIn's 'policy' is that any payments are 'non-refundable' - this is both unreasonable business practice, and effectively unlawful.

As their 'customer service' is virtually non-contactable, by any method, the only recourse remaining is a legal one.  Since the amount in my case is small, this is clearly not worth it, but I imagine LinkedIn do very well out of this situation spread across many unsuspecting new 'customers'.

Beware, and don't sign up for any free-trials!",Person,,kiyoshi shima,https://uk.trustpilot.com/users/5e245083616781c96984055f,Thing,Linkedin,Organization,Trustpilot,https://uk.trustpilot.com,Rating,1
