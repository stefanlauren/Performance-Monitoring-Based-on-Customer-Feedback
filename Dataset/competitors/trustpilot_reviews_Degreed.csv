Degreed offers just that through peer review. However, I filled out my application for the certification and the payment page froze when I pressed submit. But it charged me on my credit card's end. I emailed customer support and they refunded me. So I tried again. and again. It never worked. I would be charged and yet my certification application never went through. Customer support was swift with refunding me, but I just wanted to submit that application for a certification and it never happened. They took ages to finally offer me a coupon and by that time it was too late. Don't use Degreed. It's a hassle. They seem to mean well but the site doesn't work.",Person,customer,https://uk.trustpilot.com/users/59d2d09a0000ff000ad03e8f,Thing,Degreed,Organization,Trustpilot,https://uk.trustpilot.com,Rating,2
