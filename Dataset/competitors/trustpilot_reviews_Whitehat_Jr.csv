Platform UI/UX: could be better. Needs improvement
Customer service: overall good
Teachers: overall good. Few substitute teachers weren't up to the mark.
Value for money: Very Expensive @ >Rs. 500 for a class!! At least for upgradation like for us from 48 classes to 144 classes, there should have been cost reduction consideration. Moreover, felt there's an improvement opportunity here in terms of transparency and honesty. Initially the contact person fixed our price for 96 classes at Rs 40,000 but finance again overruled & increased the price stating it was incorrect price. I had to pay additional amount, this clearly shows lack of transparency. 
We wanted to avail maths classes as well but prices were too high. 
Rs 500 for a virtual class of grade 5 is way too high. 
Transparency need to improve on the points system and on the project getting selected for publishing for the kids across!!

Communication between those in the company is unfortunately not as good as it could be, but overall I am happy they were truthful in their refund. 

UPDATE: ~16hrs later, they did call me and proceed with the ""refund."" I have updated the review from 1 star to 3 stars as the guy who worked with me was amazing. I have been a mess and he was phenomenal. I will update the review again when the refund comes through (I was told 5-6 business days).

I have asked for a refund on the app class. We have not used any of the classes and I purchased (at first call 3hrs) 5hrs before hand. My bank still showed pending. The bank told me to call them and cancel on their end. Customer service was only able to make me a ticket and not transfer me to anyone that could help! I want a refund!

   White Hat Jr not only expose the young kids to the world of CODING which is the essential qualification  to turn the complexities of the new world into those of possibilities but instil them with the skills and abilities by triggering their very inherent 'urge' to learn. Besides being  at full liberty to learn and proceed at their own pace, the children have enough
opportunities for the development of their mental and social qualities as well. Thus, each new experience makes them confident enough to be more constructive and equally productive right from their formative years so that they acquire the ability to look at the world in a whole new perspective.

Communication is great - I connect  with Mr. Vishwanath who have been very helpful with any questions or issue that arises. I am so glad I have him  to communicate. He has been definitely the reason I have signed up for both my kids! Thank you Mr. Vishwanath!
 
I love the Dashboard, its easy to use and gets me very organized for their classes! 

The Teachers are kind and are teaching Keenan and Branden great skills for the future! 

I have called the concierges when I had some simple questions and they are great  answering the questions as well.

I have contacted many of my friends to refer WhiteHatJr for their kids and I truly hope they become your students as well.

We have received their certificate laminated by mail straight from India to Canada, which I think is such a cute gesture; The kids always smile when they open their envelope :-)

The other thing I like is that whenever the kids finish a class they have a cheer and confetti comes down on the screen. Very sweet.
The leader board is a great incentive as well!

I am so glad I found WhiteHatJr!
A very HAPPY Costumer!

544,Review,2021-02-08T19:46:52+00:00,Not Impressed with the way they have treated us,en,"I enrolled my son for a course after the company gave a tutorial which I liked. In there system they wrote down our wrong address. I spoke with their support multiple times at different occasions (I have spent many hours with their support teams being bounced around from one team to the next), however their incompetent support was unable to update my address. Their teaching staff on the other hand was good and I feel like my son has learned many different concepts. 


The problem basically arose once my son completed the first part of the course and they had to send the completion certificate. Since they hadn't corrected the wrong address I never received the certificate of completion. I have paid a lot of money to enroll my son and they can't even send me the certificate. This is unacceptable and I am very disappointed in their crappy system. I am now tired of trying to get the issue corrected and thus leaving this negative review.  

Personally, I would not recommend them due to the above mentioned reasons.

The only thing was that he did not put any time or effort into it outside classes, so  I reached out to the company and told them that I‚Äôm going to try other options for him. My son had a session with a private teacher, and after that I‚Äôve received the shocking news. What my son had learned during the 50 classes it can be learned in 2-4hours(depends on the skills) , also that WhiteHatJr is using a program that is developed for 7-8 years old kids and(!) the program they are using is doing the 80%of the coding itself, so only 20%of the work required by the child, which means they won‚Äôt be able to do coding from scratch. I have asked for refund as I felt a kind of fooled and WhiteHatJr did not deliver what they promised. No refund given. 
I would not recommend this company for those who‚Äôs kid wants to learn real coding.
Reply to WhiteHatJr: thank you for your reply to this feedback, although the issue has not been resolved, as you know.

I have been associated with WHJ in regard to providing some additional knowledge in terms of coding to my son Japneesh. Initially, I was not quite sure that I would have enrolled my son in this programme but looking at the curiosity and sort of inclination towards this I have changed my mind and start gathering information regarding this particular course. I have been provided with complete customer support and service which is expected from a professional institute.

But likewise, every coin has two sides so we need to adhere both sides in terms of appreciation and scope of improvement. I must appreciate the response time in which your respective team is dealing with the customers and the support system is also remarkable. But on the contrary, your team should address the reviews and feedback given at different platforms rather sending the clients system-generated messages. Your team need to be precise while dealing with any sort of review or feedback coming from any sort of social media platform. 

Secondly, at times it is being noticed that there are certain issues or information which is not being updated and taken care of at your designated website which somehow does not give a good impression on the client. 

Please take above-mentioned reviews as the scope of improvement and wishing your team good luck for your upcoming projects.",Person,,Navneet Singh,https://uk.trustpilot.com/users/60145554455229001a64134c,Thing,WhiteHat Jr,Organization,Trustpilot,https://uk.trustpilot.com,Rating,4

They are very passionate and knowledgeable about coding.They inspired my son to achieve his best by providing a very well thought out and structured organized program. It is so well designed that it has rewards, points system, badges, awards and  many other incentives that really helped to motivate my son and give him something to strive for. Everyday he is really excited for his next coding class and projects. He is learning so much. I am really glad we signed up.The skills he learns from here will open many doors of opportunities for him in the future.

Anytime we have a technical issue on our end, their techs are super efficient and knowledgeable.  My 2nd grader is learning a lot, and looks forward to his classes. My 9th grader, mostly enjoys his classes. They have a different level of classes for his age group. But he doesn't think he is learning much. Mostly because he has learned much of it on his own..He feels like some of the types of activities are still geared toward a younger age, even if the material he is learning is age appropriate.  I will say that the folks at White hat Jr. Do try to work with you on any issues. I have no doubt that when I bring the issue above to their attention, we will be able to work something out.  Overall I have been very happy with the program. The classes are very flexible and easy to schedule.  The are dogged communicators. When they need to reach you for any reason they keep trying.

You wanted constructive feedback and non-offensive words? so you got it. Are you still want to ""suggest"" how my feedback should look?
It's very annoying that a company like WhiteHat Jr pretends to control the way customer leave feedback.

We have had numerous occasions where we plan based on scheduled classes and 5 minutes after we log in on the scheduled time we get a notification the the class has been cancelled. This happened today as well and this is probably the 7th or 8th time in the last 2 months or so that this has happened. It feels like Whitehat feels like the customer's time and schedule is less important than theirs. 

I totally understand that things happen, especially with a pandemic going on. The feedback is regarding the system and notifications to the parents. This has gotten worse after the recent acquisition by Byju. 

We do value the teacher and my son loves her classes but it is all pointless if we cannot adhere to a schedule and can't plan around it.

I miss your calls, as I am unsure when I am getting a spam call since the election, because there are so many coming toball ofnour phonelines.  I also run 4 companies and cannot always answer phone calls, but messages on whatsapp... text, and recorded voice, I can read when I have free moments in between running the 4 small companies.
I have VERY much enjoyed working with all of the people I have had a relationship with from WhiteHat's Jr... another reason I enjoy keeping the same team.
I also noticed that my son missed out on some deadlines due to our timezone, just to inform you.  I got an email late at night, and midnight was the deadline... only a few hours until said deadline.  If I had gotten a Whatsapp txt instead of, 9r in addition to the email, I would have noticed it.  We get so many emails, but less Whatsapp messages, so they are easier to track in the sea of spam we get, and our son's progress and opportunitiesare certainly NOT spam.  It was the CEO for a day contest that I am referring to above.
I only recount these experiences as an aid for your desire to improve... not as complaints, as I have been very grateful for your help in home schooling my son.  It has been a string of Cosmic Synchronicity leading my son to be able to be a student, and have the desire, and capabilities to do so.  Being home schooled, the leaderboard has been a VERY encouraging aspect.  He has been #1 and #2 quite consistantly.  He can experience feeling proud of his hard work in a new way... as it stands out among others, a newer element for life-long home schooled students. Variety of experience is important, and supplimental options for home schooling parents has proven to be a wise contrast in experience for my son... improving his focus, drive, and concepts of time, in addition to all of the many aspects taught within the actual lessons!!!  :)

917,Review,2020-11-18T17:10:53+00:00,"Great curriculum and instructors, but sales experience is lacking",en,"I‚Äôve been very impressed with the WhiteHat Jr classes. We are about 4 months in, and I can see growth in my son‚Äôs ability to think through things logically. His instructor has brought out his personality and shows real interest in his learning. I also really enjoy the simplicity in the communications and the website (dashboard) that is used as the platform for the classes. 
Having said this, a couple areas that I feel could use improvement are... 1. When the sales people call, they call from random US-based numbers, so I don‚Äôt know who is calling. When I pick up, they don‚Äôt ask, ‚ÄúIs now a good time for you to talk?‚Äù  Sometimes they catch me while I‚Äôm serving the kids dinner and I feel like I have to cut off the person mid-sentence to let them know it‚Äôs not a good time for me to talk. It would be better if they had one consistent number they‚Äôre calling from (so I can screen the call and simply call back if it‚Äôs not a good time) or text me to see if I‚Äôm available or call from a random number, but ask if the timing is okay when I answer. 2. The sales people don‚Äôt always seem to update each other. I can sign up for more classes with one guy and still receive a call the next day from someone different asking if I want to sign up for more classes. I then have to inform the second guy that I already purchased a new set of classes with someone else.",Person,,Reena,https://uk.trustpilot.com/users/5fb5559c4b517b001931e1ae,Thing,WhiteHat Jr,Organization,Trustpilot,https://uk.trustpilot.com,Rating,4

Its fairly easy process with most Teachers are based in India. We took a trial class which was good and then we purchased 48 class pack. My son is loving the classes and is about to finish the course. While everything has been going well there are a few things I want to highlight here which I am concerned with.
1) I want to move him to Python and not continue on website design. While I did request the same, no one from Whitehat Jr gave me that option
2) When we moved to Daylight saving in US, there time clock did not adjust for US time. There was a mix up on day 1 and from then on it has become hard to get slots with the same teacher. I would expect their system to change based on the customer and not based on teacher's time frame.
3) The 3rd issue I had was when my son booked a class for the very next day by mistake thinking he is booking for the week after. As soon as he realized the mistake he cancelled the class which was within 5 minutes of booking. Still a credit was deducted. I had to argue with the customer service agent to get the credit back. It should be a simpler process.

I feel like as the codes got more complex the teacher didn't understand the code herself. She was just telling me to write stuff down and watch it work. If I had a problem in doing one of my projects, the teacher would just wait until the next class, just for me to copy down more lines of code provided by whitehat. Thats like teaching someone a language by making them write down sentences without telling them what the letters mean and what the meaning of the combined letters are.

1020,Review,2020-11-04T05:24:03+00:00,Not overly impressed,en,"We decided to try this out after a suggestion from a friend who is an IT professional. After a free session, I could see our 8 year old was very excited and since he liked coding at school, we decided to spend Australian $35 a class for 18 sessions. Thats right! $35! Definitely not cheap. Regardless, thats what you do if that brings a smile to your kids face, yes? 
Classes were good, and the teacher seemed to know what she was doing too. Although, they keep sending you endless marketing material, along with reminders of how amazing your child is, and how their ingenuity is in the 92nd percentile matching those of some famous personality... what a bunch of hogwash, just to keep your business. 
Fast forward to the end of the package and some random mktg dude contacts me to stress on ""how proud I should be as a parent coz my kid is apparently a genius"" *eyeroll*
Anyway, so this guy offers me an amazing discount by shaving off another $10 a class... thats $25 a session. Thats still way off from about $11.50 a class that a friend in Delhi paid for his child for 56 sessions (I got to know about this after I had already paid for the first session). So like any other hard working parent, I ask for a lower rate. Guess what? There are different rates for people in different countries. Thats discrimination, if you look at it. Anyway, so I give in and ask to be offered atleast $15 a session for a similar number of classes to what my friend in India had signed up for. Not gonna happen, I was told. I was ""encouraged"" to sign up for atleast 10 classes for $25 per session, and then think about the rest. Of course, I did not.

I spoke to my child about his experience, and while he wanted to continue with coding sessions, he was not fussed if we looked around for similar lessons. 

Overall, we are happy with the teachers and the fact that our kid was enjoying the lessons. We refuse to take this too seriously, as some sort of a gateway to Silicon Valley and all that nonsense, but we were happy to continue if our child enjoyed it, but not at that ridiculous price. Surely not when others are getting it at a lot cheaper rate. And also, they just overdo the 'your child is Einstein' BS, just to make some money. They are great with Marketing their brand, but definitely not worth the money.

Slightly above average, but expensive. And be warned if you do not reside in India.

Fortunately, all conversations are recorded by me so each of these can be backed.

I brought the 144 classes and currently a member of whitehat JR.

Do not trust sales promise. They told me that teachers will be from IIT and will have good IT experience. How to check ‚Äì Register for trail class, ask this question ‚Äì what is the qualification of teachers. Post they promise you, ask CV, Check on LinkedIn and public sources. The profile will not be even 1/10 of what they promised.

Write directly to CEO ‚Äì This is a complete scan. This option takes you to some random support person who has no clue what your issues are and never will clearly close the complaint over email. No evidence of acceptance or rejection of formal fraud(the promise of IIT teachers) over email. You cannot reach CEO.

Geared towards making you and your kid's marketing workforce ‚Äì If you observe, all rewards are based on a kind of lucky draw. No transparency for any of these competitions. The primary driver is how much social media content are you able to share that can promote. Your kids will earn points by sharing Halloween cards, the same points that they earn when they do programming. To qualify for any price you must share everything along with kids' photo on social media( is it even safe?)

Gamification for bad ‚Äì Entire dashboard is geared towards making you and your kids believe you are top of the world. Leaders dashboard is global but you will always fine 10-11 kids only. Most likely your kids will be in two 1-2 ??. Makes you feel nice. But if you observer, way your go on top is by consistently paying for a class and not by your talent of solving really hard problems or test. No single point is really linked to true talent. It actually is linked to how many classes you take in a week.

Do not trust the teacher will remain with you ‚Äì After a failed attempt of getting an IIT teacher, I finally landed an ‚ÄúOK‚Äù teacher. One fine day she vanished without a trace. All my booked classes are gone.

New teacher? ‚Äì Each teacher works back to back teaching exact same thing every hour to kids for 9 hours. A new teacher was latterly shouting at my kid in front of me. Although no bad words were used, my daughter did not like the teacher. My daughter had more emotional intelligence than her. The teacher was making my daughter feel a fool.

Support ‚Äì By default, you will not get any ticket number. You will be able to reach someone on chat in under 30 seconds, but for any issues that may damage the whitehat brand, they will call you and try to make you feel better leaving no evidence over chat or formal email. You will get many calls but not a single one will address your issue.

Teacher profiles ‚Äì This is the biggest scan of all. You will be promised that you will get the choice and a teacher profile. Ask for it and you will understand the scam. I have formal ones and evidence that they all are untrue.

Content? ‚Äì You have lifetime access ‚Äì To what? they do not have any class content. You can not revisit the class ones taken. Your kid will have no way to revise what was done. You can only go to the past projects your kids did. What they sell is code.org.

Advance topics ‚Äì I am an AIML expert myself. When I saw the syllabus I was impressed. This is why I took this. Be assured this is a scan. These advance topics are ‚Äúcoming soon‚Äù and none of the teachers have any idea about them.

Past social media post ‚Äì I am not sure about this but search for Whathat scam and Wolf Gupta. Looks like whitehat manipulates the social media. It is not hard to get good reviews these days. If you want evidence then check mouth shut. Most of the reviews are anonymous and look like are standard copy pest.

Is the idea good? ‚Äì The idea of teaching kids about programming is very good. But associating false expectations just to sell product unethically is bad. I am IT person and I got fooled, I wonder how much non IT parent will be able to protect himself from such a scam.

Everything about this company is amazing. The interview process is a bit lengthy. But it was worth it. 
Below are the pros:
1) the flexible hours
2) company culture
3) there are group of teachers available to support each other.
4) salary structure : the more u work the more u can earn
5) 24x7 chat and concierge service available for u to clear ur doubts. 
6) personal mentor is given to ensure faster growth in this company and if u have doubts about curriculum,u can get it cleared
7) personal relationship manager is provided so that if u are facing any issues, they will get it sorted for u
8) u get international exposure with the comfort of your home. Can u imagine this in any other platform!!! 
9) job satisfaction. U teach kids coding. U not only nurture their coding proficiency, u help them to achieve new heights in life. 
10) the most impressive thing for me is the curriculum. It not only teaches kids, it also teaches the teachers as well. I've spent lacs of rs in my master's degree. I wish WhiteHatJr was there in my times. Nobody taught me anything in my college. Not to build apps or games. Nothing. The curriculum was made so nicely that it made me wonder what thoughts and careful planning went into it to develop such masterpiece!! 
 
List of cons: only 2
1) no holidays
2) cancellation policy is not flexible but I understand students will feel dejected if teachers cancels the classes whenever they want.

This is definitely the best company to work for I must say.",Person,https://user-images.trustpilot.com/5f7ea6e608bffd0012e41391/73x73.png,Payal Banik,https://uk.trustpilot.com/users/5f7ea6e608bffd0012e41391,Thing,WhiteHat Jr,Organization,Trustpilot,https://uk.trustpilot.com,Rating,4

1172,Review,2020-10-04T18:50:49+00:00,Work Life at Whitehat Jr.,en,"The story starts like this, in the lockdown the Supreme Court had suddenly shut down, leading a lot of lawyers to be jobless and I being a lawyer was effected by that. Right then I came across Whitehat Jr., Since the start I was good with computers and when I gave 3 very difficult rounds of interview I was selected. 
Teacher point of you:
I was amazed to see the platform, so organized a teacher does not face any problem in any thing. I am so independent can choose my own time, any dates, all according to my comfort.
Coming to work life, the best part is there is not competition, everyone is so supportive. You have you own goals and they are you driving force. The more you give to the company you get equal return.
The best part is the tech support, as we all know in many parts of India Internet Connectivity is a huge problem. The tech team replies in just 30 secs and they try their level best to make the student join the class.
Child point you:
It is the first company, which has bought a coding curriculum for children starting from the age of 6. starting at this age is so important, this is the age when children develop interest in things they do. If a child starts coding at this age their interest is very likely to  build in this field. This field is so important for the coming future, you can be in any profession and this knowledge will always help you.
After taking many classes at this platform, I am amazed the children just 6yrs old are able to do the activities so easily. It is the time where parents have no time to sit with their children and they play games and watch TV all the time, instead of that this course can give them so much, it can change their lives completely.

Hats off to Karan Bajaj and his team for bringing this amazing teaching and learning program.
I can just go on taking about the company, I am so amazed. Being a lawyer i have don't huge amount of cases for tech giants but I never see such a organized portal.",Person,,mahima mongia,https://uk.trustpilot.com/users/5f7a19825094260cf98b146a,Thing,WhiteHat Jr,Organization,Trustpilot,https://uk.trustpilot.com,Rating,4

1. The platform is work from home! What better place do you need, what else comfort would you demand in a job.
2. And to add on to that the best part is that you can work as per your working hours. That is best thing.
3. And now the point you must be looking for - The PAY STRUCTURE - I can assure anyone who works here makes handsome amount of money if they really enjoy the work and do it full heartedly.
4. You got to work with KIDS!! I don't think this point needs any explanation. Kids are so sweet and lovely and interacting with them makes the day at times (from personal experience). The amount of excitement and creativeness that they bring is beyond imagination.
5. The international exposure - There is no limit to growth here. You keep on growing be it in your place or the country. You get to interact with international students and parents also.
6. A teacher is one of the most respectable jobs you would come across :) 
7. Work life balance - you have the power in your hand. 
8. The people above you - your reporting manager, your mentor is always ready to help you out and is very supportive. 
And the list just goes on, these are just the quick points that have come to my mind. Other than this the healthcare insurance, the support from the support team be it technical, curriculum, or anything is superb, the incentives, the rewards are just too good.",Person,,Ayushi Shukla,https://uk.trustpilot.com/users/5f78a5995094262b7c8a8cc7,Thing,WhiteHat Jr,Organization,Trustpilot,https://uk.trustpilot.com,Rating,5

1434,Review,2020-10-03T13:53:34+00:00,Superb working experience,en,"I am a teacher with Whitehat Junior for last 6 months and my experience is so far great.
I worked in software industry for 5 years and then due to some personal reason had to leave my job. I have a toddler of 2 years now and when I decided to start working again, I was in dilemma. I didn't want to go back to IT industry because there we get hardly any time (At least in India) for our family also I wanted to do something which has some meaning. Teaching is my passion, even during college I used to give private tuitions and I loved it. Even I used to teach my batch mates in some subjects and according to them I am a great teacher. So, I wanted to pursue this passion but it was very difficult for me to go outside and get a job during that time as we got this pandemic hit. With a small kid at home and with the lockdown it was impossible to get a job. Suddenly I saw this Ad in Facebook about WHJ teaching job and I just applied to check it out. When they said it is about teaching coding to young kids of aged 5 to 14 years the first question I asked ""How do you teach coding to such small kids?"". With the answer I was not satisfied and I had so much time to spend, so I thought let's give interview and check it out. I saw WHJ vision, their curriculum and the class structure while giving demo classes. I just loved it. So, when I was selected, I was very excited and enthusiastic to start teaching. But still I was hesitant about the fact that this is completely work from home with such a lucrative offer. I was thinking it can't be true! But when I got my first month payout, I was sure that it is damn true. Since then no more doubts and I am teaching here for last 6 months. I have got promoted to mentor after just 4 months and mentoring the new teachers in the panel to have a wonderful journey like me. During these 6 months I have learnt so much. I have learnt how this young generation is so interested in coding. I sometimes get so amazed by their coding skills and the way they want to learn more at this age. Their aptitude to learn coding is so wonderful and it is surprising to me and their parents as well sometimes. They ask so intelligent questions which sometimes I also have to research for them. Now a days, they just not happy with a video game to play, they want to make their own game and then play. I wish I had this platform during my childhood, I might have done better in my career as an IT professional. This company is growing, so as we all teachers and our experiences. When I joined everything was flexible but very scattered. But now it is so streamlined. We have this mentorship which is so helpful sometimes. We have relationship managers who are like our guiding stars. They guide us so well with so much patience. Of course, the financial independence is another added advantage. Sitting at home this much earning, I think was impossible before. So as a whole I am just loving my job. I want to pursue this as long as possible because here I am making some difference actually.",Person,,Nabanita Sinha,https://uk.trustpilot.com/users/5f78824e2af0b76f749e2d21,Thing,WhiteHat Jr,Organization,Trustpilot,https://uk.trustpilot.com,Rating,5

2. WFH gives a lot of advantage to cut down all the additional exp of travel and outside food.
3. It allows me to take a break in btw to make my meals, spend time with family, and get back to take my classes at the scheduled time.
4. 24*7 any time any no of hrs you can select to work and you get paid for every hour that you have committed. 
5. The pay structure is very very transparent. I know exactly what I have made after the end of my day.
6. The payment is very good in terms of WFH job.
7. The support team is very strong and we get instant resolution to any problem.
8. This is a great way to introduce coding to kids at such a young age. The curriculum is designed in such a way that kids enjoy coding as they are learning new things.
9. After class projects make the kids push themselves in a fun-filled way to code a different activity all by themselves.
10. Coding activity makes the kids think differently. Instead of just playing games, now they think about how to make those games that they enjoy playing. 
It really makes the kids a creator than just a consumer.",Person,,Be Your Best,https://uk.trustpilot.com/users/5f787b407a7d7387ed4fed6f,Thing,WhiteHat Jr,Organization,Trustpilot,https://uk.trustpilot.com,Rating,5

1480,Review,2020-10-03T12:14:38+00:00,Awesome,en,"Few months ago, if I had to introduce myself, I would say I am assistant professor working in an engineering college with a burning desire to become an Associated Professor. But sadly, never had time to focus on studies because of my 7am to 7pm job.
Then came the pandemic followed with a lockdown which brought me back to home for all day, I must tell you, this is time when I felt what I was missing out of life and that was my family time.
But again, money matters soon after lockdown the salary started dropping off from 100% to 50% to 25% and then even got delayed by months.
Like every other engineering student who has the habit of trying to answer viva questions even if the definition asked for sounds like Greek and Latin, I also thought of trying Whitehat jr.
This is where the turning point came in, with the flexibility of choosing your own timings and the amount of support and respect I got here. It been the best job ever.
1.	I could spend a lot of time with family after years of being labelled as a professional career oriented woman, now I am completely family person and I am truly loving it.

2.	I could finally concentrate on my dream of becoming an Associate Professor by pursing PhD and dedicating at least 10 hours of my day to studies.

3.	I can tell for sure what I am earning here is two to three times more than what I earned through my full-time job i.e., getting three months salary just by sitting at home and teaching little kids. The best part is I can increase or decrease my slots each month and accordingly my salary changes.  So, when I have an exam, I can reduce timings by just few clicks, no running behind the higher authorities to just get 1 CL of month.

4.	The world of white hat jr has extremely supportive people who are always there to help you. As soon as I joined, I was given a Mentor, a RM and off course the tech team. Even if the mouse isn‚Äôt working, I can text and there‚Äôs someone there to fix it up.

5.	The students are the best part, I always dealt with engineering students, here I got the chance to meet kids who are enthusiastic to learn with there bright eyes and smiling faces, they truly make my day. I have kids from around the world like US, UK, Australia, Philippines, Canada, Singapore, New Zealand and off course my country India and through this platform I am getting to learn the culture of various other people.

6.	The curriculum has been designed in a way that it completely follows a practical approach, So, I could actually see the kids learning to code, creating apps and games and adding their own creativity, unlike the college agenda of just obtaining theoretical knowledge for getting good grades in test. And surprisingly I am also learning quite a lot of new things through the webinars that are conducted for the teachers.

So, all in all It has been a great experience and Yes, it is too good to be true. But mark my words

Finally I was offered a job where I started it with excitement. Later it became a very long day of work where I had very less time for myself and my family, they were expecting me to learn new skills where I was not interested in and there was no gap for me to showcase my skills. That was the time I realized I needed to find an opportunity where I could showcase my skills and help others . In search I found whitehat jr and I applied for a job, which is really a unique company for showcasing built-in skills of women. My parents have 3 daughters and no one working at home, two sisters are married, i wanted to help my family financially so i don't know how many companies i travelled to get jobs, but finally god made me a member in this beautiful company where i am happy with work, as well i am supporting my family financially as well spending enough of time with family.

	  As well its a very great platform for kids to showcase their talent as well they play and learn coding, and we give them enough space to explore their creativity and there by they will improve their thinking capacity and their way of thinking also get wider, which improves there thinking capacity, logical thinking etc. I want to whole heartedly thank Jayshree Patel mam, Raj sir, Priyanka Thapliyal¬†¬†mam, Amanpreet kaur mam, Hasan Abidi sir and all other family members for their support.

Your Mentor, RM, Concierge, Chat Support are always there 24x7 to help you out with whatever you need.

Greetings of the day!

I am Poorva, a teacher at Whitehat Jr.

In this pandemic where people were striving to find and stabilize their jobs, there was one company that welcomed the teachers open heartedly to join their network. 

It was WHITEHAT JR. 

In the modern era where there is so much advancement in the technology and services, Whitehat provides a platform to the students to make them technology expert at a very young age. 
WhiteHat Jr is the best Kids Coding Platform where kids are taught to code online by our expert teachers.

It is believed that a beginner is open for learning and grabbing new things easily. 
Coding is a basic literacy in this digital age, and it is important for kids to be able to work with and understand the technology around them.
Having children learn coding at a young age prepares them for the future. It helps children with communication, creativity, math, writing and confidence. It enhances their skills and be fit for the upcoming advanced life style and standards.

Whitehat helps students to build a strong pillar and a strong support for their family.

Apart from this, there are various things which are just awesome about Whitehat:

1. Flexible Working Hours : For women who deal with time management problems, Whitehat gives you flexible working hours where you can select your time by your own.

2. Financial Stability : I love the way Whitehat pays. In the world where teachers are paid less, Whitehat gives you an opportunity to earn 50K and more per month that too by working from home.

I'm Thankful to WhiteHat Jr for giving me an opportunity to join the team, pursue my teaching passion and building innovative skills in children.",Person,,Poorva Paliwal,https://uk.trustpilot.com/users/5f75a62d4b244e5b2d680b40,Thing,WhiteHat Jr,Organization,Trustpilot,https://uk.trustpilot.com,Rating,5

The best part about whitehat jr is you get to earn and have satisfaction because you‚Äôre contributing towards the future generation.
When I graduated I had 2 offers in my hand, one as a decision scientist in a company and another was a teacher with Whitehat Jr. I thought a lot before choosing. Whitehat jr was focused on teaching coding to kids. I being a Computer Science Engineer know it very well how important it is to teach kids coding and in the right way. I was unsatisfied by the theoretical knowledge I got from school for coding/computer science. Because if Coding/Computer Science, if not taught practically is of no use. When I read about Whitehat jr and their teaching pattern I was highly impressed and wanted to contribute to get the kids right way of learning to code. Also, it was Work from home which was a bonus during this pandemic. Along with it, the policy of the company is simple ‚Äú the better you perform, the better you earn‚Äù which again encouraged me to choose Whitehat jr.",Person,,AMBA,https://uk.trustpilot.com/users/5f7584482480d05ecec9213c,Thing,WhiteHat Jr,Organization,Trustpilot,https://uk.trustpilot.com,Rating,5

There seems to be this crazed zeal and push to ""sell"" their program, incl fairly weird assessments for children. I know my kid and was nearby when the trial class was on. The class was actually conducted well.. but the assessment was a very high rates review of my child ... which I know was now where near the truthful personality my child is. 

Now the only reason we are hesitant to enroll is coz of this ridiculously false exceptionalism of my childs performance. I know my child is good but not a genius the child is potrayed as. Another two parents who have tried seemed conned by this evaluation for their child ... 

I mean the conning really isnt reqd. They hv good faculty and a good model going. Why this ""western pushy marketing"" facade! Anyone who wants to do a trial class probably is in a 60% mindframe to enroll anyways. Really 3 whtsapp msgs, 2 emails, 1 call for a trial class ..... I was more engaged in the follow up for the trial class more than the eventual class itself. 

Again they seem to hv balanced teachers, there is no need to potray a child as a super achiever, that pushes the teacher to then lead the child to the work instead of letting the kid learn too.

I'm not sure about you, but doesn it seem funny that every message says there is just one palce left?  
I was very tempted initally by what WHJ offer but the marketing and recruitment strategy has put me off totally.  
Originally I came across them via a facebook ad which stated free coding.  What that really ment was a basic inital session which didn't last that long and was more of a drag and drop exercise.  They specifically ask for the parent to stay around and then do a big 20-30min sales pitch comes into play for their courses.  
I wish WHJ well, I really do but I do feel that there is a certain lack of integrity in their business modle that just doesn't suit our family.  
Reading the reviews most of them lack substance or relate to a completed course and some even appear to be about working for the company!!!!  I'm guessing the later is a ploy to re-estabilsh higher ratings after a poor review.

I used the free assessment to gauge my 9yo daughters interest and her incredibly positive reaction made me decide to go ahead with a paid for set of classes.

I still had my doubts about how long my daughters interest will last, which has increasingly grown with each class. As an ex programmer, I have observed each of the classes so far and have found their methods very effective. Just yesterday they covered binary in a foundational way that is very sound.

Additionally, I thought there would be a communication challenge with accents, which has proven not to be a problem at all.

Paying for a bunch of classes up front made it seem  expensive, which when you break down this to a cost per class and realize that the tuition is 1 to 1, it seems a fair price to pay.

So, so far, I feel this has been one of my best investments in my daughters future. It remains to be seen how the rest of the curriculum goes, but if the net result is my daughter being extremely confident with computers, programs and looking at them as more than just gaming platforms, then it is a huge win.",Person,,David Naude,https://uk.trustpilot.com/users/5e8dec334d2b56645ac1dd69,Thing,WhiteHat Jr,Organization,Trustpilot,https://uk.trustpilot.com,Rating,5

Sharing my yesterday's experience with WhiteHat Jr. with all the parents üôÇ

I booked a free online coding class for my 9year old child for 1hour yesterday (18th September 2020).

The class was great. 
The online teacher was well-equipped with the knowledge and understood my child's mentality so well that she was able to complete the course in stipulated time frame. The co-ordination between them in just 10-15min was excellent.
The study concept and material are designed in such a way that for the child it feels like he's playing a drag-n-drop puzzle game while he learns everything.

Parents are allowed to join the class and sit beside the child throughout the class which I did, and are allowed to interact with the teacher if needed.

The complex concept of coding/programming goes inside the young child's brain so smoothly was unbelievable for me. My child too enjoyed the class thoroughly and even after that for 2.5hrs engrossed with the coding/software link sent by WhiteHat on the email id.
The class was far more superb than my expectations.üëçüèª

After the class, I understood one thing for sure, the way WhiteHat is providing technical education to kids is really innovative than any future college or institution would do for the child.

Internet data used was less than 1GB on a Hotspot.
No charges at all for the free demo class. 
You just need a Computer with internet connection & an email id. 

I advice and request you to book at least the demo class for any child present at your home or recommend the demo class to anyone with a child between age group 6 and 14 at their home, because it costs nothing and pays a lot.

Let me start by saying this whoever is the CEO DOES NOT CARE AT ALL. My experience with this coding platform was awful! If you want to throw your money in the water enroll your kids. 

I have sent multiple emails but, never got a response from the so-called support team. My son was enrolled this summer (2020) we are not happy with WhiteHatJr. Our overall experience was not good I wish I could rate them zero stars.

WhiteHatJr now wants to contact me ü§Ø. Just because they saw my review! What happened to those 10+ emails and WhatsApp messages that I have sent and never heard back from you guys? 

Everyone I‚Äôm in IT Industry for 17+ years I have never seen such a fraud company rip off children especially in Education. 

Please DO NOT enroll your kids. It‚Äôs waste of time and money.

So, here I‚Äôm with some updates!

-WhiteHatJr reported my review because I shared my experience here that I had with their unprofessional staff and the way they ripped me off by lying about their platform.

-They said I never used their platform how cheap is that. I have provided the emails and WhatsApp chat that I had with everyone at WhiteHatJr!

-People the bottom line is that this coding platform is not for kids in the U.S.A period. 

-A COMPLETE GARBAGE AND WASTE OF MONEY.

UPDATE!

WhiteHatJr, you guys tried to take down my review by reporting it! But, I submitted the proofs of how you guys handled the situation that I had with your unprofessional team from sales to upper management! YOU ALL SUCK. 

Now, look at your reply!

10.7.2020 UPDATE!

So, a guy name Jayesh contacted me on 9.22.2020 and asked me to forward him my concerns regarding this review which I did and he promised that he will take care of the problem I had with WhiteHatJr today is 10.7.2020 and I have not heard back from Jayesh even though I follow up with him the only reply I get back is ‚ÄúI have forwarded your concerns to the upper management‚Äù 

Now it‚Äôs up to you guys if you still want to enroll your kiddos!!! This company is a fraud period.

update 10.23.2020

Just a quick update for those of you thinking to enroll your kiddos! I still haven‚Äôt heard back from WhiteHatJr. U.S parents this coding is not for your kids don‚Äôt waste your money!

I don't see any option to reply for what Whitehat JR gave me below, so this is continuation for your reply.
I was contacted by someone from Whitehat JR today after seeing my review. Don't lie on public platform, i never got any refund or confirmation email from Whitehat, just got a call and told me they will resolve the issue.
Please be aware of following things.
1. Don't even Enroll or take demo class from them. Once you take demo, torturing through emails and n number of people will call you. This course is not designed for kids who were born in America or any other country as this is totally operated from India.
2. Kids can't understand anything other than Demo class.
3. Please don't pay them any money as it will never get refund.

2435,Review,2020-08-19T17:21:55+00:00,"Phishing scam, not for me",en,"They continuously email and call you, such hounders. 
I signed up for two free trial sessions, my 8 year old had to decipher the english barrier the tutor was clearly struggling with to be able to participate  in  class. He enjoyed the class but I wouldn't sign him up, I think it would hinder his own english and grammatical/word choice, as he is still in an impressionable age. 

My 11 year old could overlook the english and was happy to attend and learn in class. 
The put off is the amount of phone calls (from different zip codes) and emails the company  sends you. 
And honestly I dont know what this company  could offer you that ""coding combat"" or ""khan academy""  could not have given you for free or lower costs. 
I did ask around and out of a group of 40+ homeschoolers 1 mom recommended  this company. 
Another dead stopper for me was that every single positive review on the internet  seemed to be written by employees or family members.

Yet you learn nothing from this, they're using a free website that anybody could access and learn something from with WAY better customer support. It seems when i entered my phone number that they forcefully made me subscribe to their newsletter. I never planned on it. Me nor my child can understand them. Don't waste your time on this. When they call FORCING my child to put on face cam. That's not ok. We don't have to always have face cam on. The only thing they were good at was making me unable to cancel the trial.  There's no option on cancelling it. If i don't return they start calling me.  DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME ON THIS. There are way better websites other than this. You can use free and GOOD websites with customer support that is ACTUALLY understandable. Such as:khanacademy. Unlike whitehatJR Khan Academy actually helps, they have video lessons and helpers.

2506,Review,2020-08-07T20:41:42+00:00,Insistent for you to purchase,en,"My child took their trial class in June. Just before the class began, I received 2 phone calls, plus emails. I didn't answer the calls because my child was already logged in and ready to start. I figured they wanted to make sure the student was going to show up and the teacher's time will not be wasted.
My child enjoyed the class. The teacher was lovely. She explained things in detail. She even showed my child apps that past students created as final projects in the program. 
Immediately after the class I received a phone call from the US from a man who claimed that the teacher personally called him to say that my child was exceptionally intelligent in the class. The teacher was in India...she immediately called him less than 5 minutes after he had completed the class? I felt pressured to purchase one of their programs. I explained that financially I was not prepared to commit that much, being a single mother, plus being in the middle of the pandemic. I had until midnight to decide! Something didn't feel right. 
My child is smart, but he is no computer genius. The man tried to guilt trip me into thinking I was ""taking away (my son's) dreams"" by not making the purchase. He also spoke of kids who won Google awards and such.  I searched on the app store after the class and none of the students' apps that the teacher showed my child came up. Strange.
Yesterday I received another call from Whitehat. A man who stated he was Manager, or CEO, or someone high up. I can't remember the status he stated he had. Offered me a discount. He was pleasant enough, so I listened to what he had to say. As before, he stated that my child's teacher personally called him and that my child was exceptional, etc. I told him financially I was not prepared to make such a committment at this time. Again, the guilt trip of taking away my child's dreams. Excuse me sir, but you don't know what my child's dreams are. He seemed to try to convince me that this course should be a priority. Excuse me sir, but feeding my child is a priority. I thanked him for his offer and told him I'd contact them in the fall if I was interested. I was somewhat annoyed but wasn't overly bothered, as I thought that would be the last I would hear from them.  I was wrong.
I just received another call from Whitehat just now. I had to literally tell the man to stop talking several times as he continued on his schpeel as if he had said this a thousand times over. I had to hang up on him. 
Whitehat, I had given you respect, I had given you my time, I had given you my child's time. You have no right to guilt trip me into thinking I am not providing for my children just because I don't chose to pay for your high priced online courses. You don't know my financial and personal situations. You have no business to harass me and pressure me into making a purchase I already politely said 'no' to more than once. That is not only poor business practice; that is poor ethics, and poor judgement.

First of all, we got several messages before the class even started all from different random numbers labeled ""spam likely"" on my phone- not a good sign. Secondly, I could hardly understand the voice message, so I was concerned upfront my child would be able to understand the teacher. The teacher greeted us and seemed fine, but was easily frustrated if we couldn't find things on the screen and was speaking to us in a way that wasn't totally pleasant. Why be a teacher if you don't have the patience to help a child? Its supposed to be fun- you can't rush them through it! Also, she kept calling my child (who is quite young) by the wrong name, which was very confusing for them and they had a difficult time understanding the teacher through the thick accent. And finally, I have a bad feeling that my computer might potentially be hacked through the screen sharing app that they were using, so... I abruptly ended the session.

2524,Review,2020-08-01T12:21:49+00:00,My Experience with White hat junior while applying for instructor position,en,"I recently attended an interview in White Hat junior and I wanted to share my experience here. First, I will give an overall idea about recruitment process.
First round was a telephonic one, they asked about the my details and shared a pdf of 50 pages.  Next I had a technical setup call with the technical team. In that they checked my Laptop and network connection. 
After that they asked me to take 3 demo classes, in those classes one of the employee will act like a student. In the first demo class they needed to teach the first 25 pages from the pdf shared. Candidate should prepare next 40 pages for second demo then full document for the third demo.
Here come the points why I got a bad impression on White Hat Junior,
I had a short telephonic discussion to start with and I was told that if I gets selected then I should  take minimum 4 hours session per day. This recruitment is for US/Canada students so the timing will be 10.30pm  -7.30 am (IST-Night shift).
But in the first demo class the interviewer told me to take minimum 30 hr per week. 
In the second demo the interviewer mentioned that the classes should be taken in both Indian and US timing.
In the 3rd demo the interviewer asked me to take 40 hours per week.
The point here is that the three interviewers are having three different rules for the same candidate. I felt they have lack in integrity about the basic things. 
They will give you the document which you have to teach and you need to teach the students it within 45 minutes. I have around 3 years of experience in teaching and very passionate about it. But the experience I got it from this platform was very humiliating and valueless by questioning the ability of a person to teach students in a stipulated time. They want people who are like robots who complete the class within 45 minutes without even understanding what the student needs, in this 45 minutes we should interact with the student, make the student understand about student panel in the system, showcase prototypes that other students have done and also need to explain entire course structure with the parent. So, you can figure out how to make the above things covered in 45 mins.
They are focusing only on business not the basic quality of teaching. If you want to make the student understand then you need to spend more time. Different students have different ability of grasping things, so as a teacher we need to understand the pulse and teach them based on that. In those cases, we can‚Äôt stick on the time. At the end of the day, student should gain some knowledge as takeaway. White hat junior is focusing only on business.
I have a request to White hat jr, If you want to get students you do some advertising/give a separate class for parents don‚Äôt evaluate the teachers teaching capability.
So, if anyone is planning to attend White Hat Junior interview, You know how it works and decided if you need opt for this or not.",Person,,silpa ms,https://uk.trustpilot.com/users/5f255e57f29c0a80f2251cfc,Thing,WhiteHat Jr,Organization,Trustpilot,https://uk.trustpilot.com,Rating,1

We had received a voicemail from them prior to the lesson and the person was difficult to understand due to the heavy accent. During the class, the woman was friendly. Her instructions and explanations weren't great, but they were alright. I did like that after the class she didn't push anything on us. She just congratulated my son on completing the class and that was it. But after the class I was getting multiple automated SMS from the company advertising their classes. They had an option to opt out by typing STOP. I did that, got a confirmation that I was removed from the list, and kept receiving their messages like before. Typed STOP again, got another confirmation, and still the messages didn't stop. Did it a third time just to be sure, but yeah, there seems to be no way to unsubscribe from their SPAM. Had to block their number.

There are many free services with block programming for kids. I would probably recommend those over WhiteHat Jr, especially if you can sit with your kids and guide them a little. I was easily able to block WhiteHat's SMSs, and if you're able to do that too, there's no harm in trying their class. But it's not that useful and the messages are rather annoying.

UPDATE Jan 2021: When I sign up for services, I sign up with an email specific to that service. This way I can filter my email better and also know that if I get SPAM for that specific email, it's that service/company that sold my email. Well, now I'm getting a TON of SPAM from ""The Motley Fool"", ""Iman from Keystone"", ""Daily Profits Team"", etc., all sent to the whitehat jr email. Not only do these folks SPAM you themselves, they also sell your data.

2612,Review,2020-07-02T22:15:35+00:00,Outstanding Experience,en,"My kid (Amir) recently completed the ""advanced course"" of WhiteHat Jr, and it was an outstanding experience.

 We are Bangali, and my kid is not an English medium student. I told them to give us a teacher who know the Bengali language and be friendly with my kid. Fortunately, we got a perfect and well-trained teacher for him.

My kid enjoyed the course and learned a lot from the exercises. In my opinion, The curriculum of ""advanced course"" is kids-friendly and helps to improve the capability of thinking.

Thanks",Person,https://user-images.trustpilot.com/5efe56ac03d7962f6283b264/73x73.png,Abdullah Al Mamun,https://uk.trustpilot.com/users/5efe56ac03d7962f6283b264,Thing,WhiteHat Jr,Organization,Trustpilot,https://uk.trustpilot.com,Rating,5
