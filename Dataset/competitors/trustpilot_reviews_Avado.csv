6,Review,2021-05-28T08:31:55+00:00,Unfortunately disappointing,en,"Lack of consistency. Lack of communication. Lack of clarity. Lack of support from 'student support'. - Not what you would expect given the price of the course. 

Noticed especially in the last unit of the course, when majority of the students passed, and a handful of us were referred with the SAME feedback (literally a copy and paste job), on detail that the others were passed on. The marking criteria is obviously not the same across all markers. I escalated the matter to Student Support who literally took weeks to reply. (They actually replied after I had already come to a resolution with my tutor after i went to her following the lack of response). 
If you cannot guarantee a response in 3 days - don't advertise it as that. I don't think i got a response that quick from them throughout the full year. 

It has now been over 5 weeks since the last submission I made; others in my group have received an email to show completion and an e-certificate. I haven't (along with others in the group too) haven't received a thing. Again, the lack of consistency across the board is ridiculous and unfair. 

There also seemed to be a constant lack of clarity around the criteria in Tutor Support Session - what the question said on paper, and then what was actually expected when explained by the tutor - Two totally different things!!

I am a returning student/customer, i did my L3 CIPD when this company was under a different name and had no problems at all and would have recommended all day long. But this time has been totally different, I haven't enjoyed it as much, I have had to chase up a lot of responses; overall not great at all.",Person,https://user-images.trustpilot.com/60b0aa7473746f0019a5eab5/73x73.png,Jasmin Stork,https://uk.trustpilot.com/users/60b0aa7473746f0019a5eab5,Thing,Avado,Organization,Trustpilot,https://uk.trustpilot.com,Rating,2

15,Review,2021-05-17T15:30:26+00:00,Avado --- Avadon't,en,"I have experienced the following issues with Avado and their Virtual Learning Campus (VLC).

*Outdated information - not relevant to assessment briefs.
* Missing/broken links.
* Hidden costs to access reference material.
* Missing text (paragraphs stop halfway through).
* Grammatical errors throughout.
* Directly copied lesson material sourced from external websites and passed off as Avado's own content (no referencing). 
* The VLC crashes frequently, after the most recent update, I am left with 100+ notifications that I am unable remove. 

Live tutorials

During a live tutorial session, my tutor advised that one specific assessment question was so badly constructed and vague, they advised that they will complain on our behalf to have it amended ...for the next cohort.

Whilst on the topic of tutors, when I have requested assistance or clarification, I have on occasion received vague and contradictory information from two tutors which is not helpful in the slightest. Surely information should be supplied in a standardized fashion and not be poles apart.

When you do try to email, or book a call to try and figure out what exactly it is that you're being asked to submit - please don't expect a swift reply - 5 days is normal if at all.

I had to email Student Services three times before they kindly sent me a response asking me to list, in detail, all their issues. 

The point is, that I should not have to list their faults, there shouldn't be any. When you are paying close to £2,000.00 you expect a polished and professional course. 

I would advise anyone looking into studying a HRM course that you do not go with Avado distanced learning but instead, go to a local college/evening- school where you have the opportunity to speak to someone.

I had such high hopes for this course, but Avado over promised and under delivered.

To add some context, I gained a 1st class undergraduate degree with the highest grades in my year, yet this level 3 course was extremely difficult due to the way materials were presented and the vagueness of questions posed, the course was the worst academic undertaking I have experienced to date.

Addendum 1 :
Please provide an email address (preferably not Student services - due to the waiting time) so that I am not required to place my personal contact details on a public forum.

Addendum 2: 24/05/2021

I have not yet had a reply to my email detailing my issues, this was sent on 15/05/2021. This delay in response is exactly what I have outlined above. This delay does not meet your advised 3-5 day response time. I may have to accept that this will not be resolved as the case has been so far. 

Addendum 3.
I have emailed student success on the 15/05/2021 as advised above. Still no answer, is there any point at this late stage? Seriously poor customer service.


Addendum 4: 6/6/21

He has supported me through my CompTIA exam and coursework with exceptional levels of care. He has gone out of his way to find and supply any extra materials I have needed, and has really helped my managers understand the apprenticeship route into business, and has enabled them to support me as well. 
In my opinion Perrans main skill is communication. I feel as though he made it very easy to build a professional and friendly relation. This really helped me feel comfortable in reaching out and asking any questions I had. No matter how stupid I may have felt them to be, he was always happy to help! 
I wish him the best in his new role and thank him for the immense amount of help in such a shot period of time.

The end result is that the student has paid for books personally as he can wait no longer or will have no time to prepare for the exams.  Christiana Harjot (Manager) and Isabella Dawe are in no hurry to sort out problems.  The only thing forthcoming is platitudes and no action.

Had a tutor change half way through the course which i wasn't happy about as i enjoyed the tutor i had at the time as they were very helpful and answered the questions we're asking. Was slow at getting back to us but thats fine.

New tutor isn't that great or helpful! Doesn't explain what we're asking and looks like they're scripted when doing cohort sessions.

Half the information is outdated and incorrect. The mini tests you do tell you you've answered wrong but its correct. Its just a lot of words on the screen if anything.

Changed from doing a diploma to a certificate due to the stress and just wanting to get it over and done with now but still paying diploma money...

Personally wouldn't recommend Avado as they just seem to care about your money rather than your qualification you work towards.

FYI 14 days isn't long enough to decide whether the course if right for you or not. I got 3 months in before i realised its not for me but having to carry on with it due to the amount of money i'm having to pay for it!

Avado should also consider different alternatives for students who find it hard to be recorded/videoed as i've broken down multiple times over these 'pratical' exams and find them extremely difficult to par take in them but was just fobbed of with 'its part of your course'. Extremely disheartening.

There are so many grammatical errors within their textbooks, it does not read right and makes you feel stupid because it doesn't make sense. They have clearly not been proofread. As there are sentences repeated.  

The online tests that you complete clearly haven't been properly checked, it marks your answer as wrong, and then the correct answer is literally the one you have written. It doesn't even explain why your answer is wrong when you have genuinely got it wrong, which would be extremely helpful. As otherwise you are left clueless.

The online classes frequently you can't see or hear the tutor. And they don't contact you when you have a question. I did a course with the OU years ago-they were excellent. Why can't you just sit the exams right at the end like you do at school? You are reading the next module when revising for an exam. Never bother with these people. £1500 wasted.

This is sold as a fully flexible course with online course material and tutors that are readily available. 

The material is online and the support sessions are recorded and available soon after. However, as experienced in the recent module I have done the assignment required approval of a title from a tutor, who only responded once in the last 48 hours of the deadline and then after I complained to him with 3 hours to go before the deadline, I get a response just saying ""I would advise to approve your title well in advance"". Except the 6 week course module is cut to a 2 week window to do the assignment as you need the support sessions to fully understand what you need to do on the assignments - which are not run until the last two weeks of the module. *rolls eyes*

Also, when raised to the tutor that I expected a better response, I was told by him that he doesn't work weekends so he is going out of his way - so why do they set a deadline of midnight Sunday if they aren't going to respond in the last two days???

Joke of an attitude.

It’s a shame this college has such a good reputation but does it really? or it’s just a hoax. 
I’ll let you know what you're looking at if you are considering an online course with them right now.
Where do I start
1) They say that everything in the course like online study material is available on their learning campus. The leaning provided are mostly google links and other websites which you need to buy membership of to view their articles.
2) Avado says they have a 24 hour student support system but when you email the tutor they take 3 days to respond. And if you call the actual support number they will put on hold for more than 10 mins only to realise that you need to email the tutor. 
3) The tutor sessions cuts out very frequently because of poor internet connectivity at tutors home. Yes, she works from home and does not bother spending more money on a better broadband package.
4) Tutor sessions are recorded to help you view them later in case you missed. However, you cannot rely on them because their recoding software does not work. And there will be no recorded sessions for you to view. 
5) The tutors are cryptic in responding to questions and confuses everyone, including themselves during tutor sessions. And if asked about anything generally will say google it.
6) If you want to change tutor or the cohort as they are really that bad, yes you can, at a price of £250 and then you will have to wait for a space in another course. Which they won’t tell you how long.
Well done Avado keep up the good work!

They have scammed me well and proper.
I signed up for the CIPD Level 3 Diploma course. Via one of their sales agents Marc Perkins. I've got emails confirming that I've signed up for this course, that would cost me £1,500 as it was on discount at the time. 
Yet, when I've started the course, the Student Success team has told me that I've been signed up for the Certificate level instead. 
I've sent they through the proof of this, my email thread with Marc, plus they can listen to my phone call with him of necessary, in which I've detailed my desire to participate in the Diploma level course. 
The student success team have now decided to ignore me. I'm currently still waiting for a response to an email I sent on the 16 th of Oct. 
In the meantime, they're still happy to continue to take my money, and not provide the services promised. 
I'm very disappointed with Avado and the service received.
Nobody seems to want to help me, referencing a mistake that they have made.

The sales pitch was great - while they are trying to get your money and sign up for multiple courses! I agree with a previous reviewer that the online classes aren't very consistent and when they do happen they aren't very useful. My main issue has been how they have handled things throughout the pandemic. I called to see what start dates would be available to commence level 3 (that I have already paid for) as i was worried because I still have my final exam to take for level 2 but my local exam centre had still not re-opened, and I wanted to get level 2 completed before commencing any further studies. After emailing and getting no response, and spending nearly 2 hours on the phone I finally got through to someone to be told that Avado is no longer offering AAT courses so the last cohort I could join was the one that started at the beginning of July. This was in the middle of August. I had no communication from Avado prior to this that they would be withdrawing AAT, and if you wanted to participate in a live class you would have to joon the July class, which I think is terrible customer service on their part. I was then also told that I had up until August 2021 to complete both my level 2 and 3, despite the fact my exams had been cancelled due to my local exam centres being closed and I'd not yet been able to take an exam through no fault of my own. When I pointed this out I was given a 3 month extension and told that was the maximum I could have. I have since managed to find another exam centre near me and finally get my UACS exam booked again, logged on to start revision and found I now have no access to Sage 50 as I previously did so I now can't even start my revision. I have spent the majority of the day on hold to Avado to try and find out why this is, and received an auto reply to my email to say they aim to get back to me within 3 working days. How is that helpful to me when my exam is in 2 weeks and I need to start my revision now.
Overall, for a company that claims to support their students to the highest level I have found them to be really quite unhelpful throughout the whole pandemic. 
Balancing family life with a job and studying is very challenging and I feel like Avado have made this experience so much harder than it needs to be during an already really difficult time. I have spent £2000 with this company and am so disappointed in the service I am now receiving (£2000 I paid well in advance of the due date, then had my account suspended for 2 days because of ""non payment"" I had to spend more time on hold then email them bank statements with proof of payment.

The other two tutors were personable and obviously knowledgeable but seemed in-experienced in teaching. The first week was delivered by someone  not familiar with the slides and presented without following a logical order in a scattershot manner. The second week was taught by someone  who sat in with us watching those lessons the session before.

Support outside of the classroom was available but not well developed. One of the tutors set up a WhatsApp group but as this is a technical field more could be done to promote support between learners and encourage a culture of idea sharing/ problem solving. In my opinion and as a reference point,  Massive Open Online Courses manage this more effectively.

The LDC was very supportive, friendly, clearly invested in my progression and very capable but seemed to be overloaded with apprentices to a near unmanageable level. To be clear; I think my LDC was excellent but Avado had put too much on them.

The Covid pandemic has impacted apprenticeship delivery but I genuinely felt as though the course was being developed around me as we were going through it and was not clearly defined, which as a learner doesn't help. It just didn't come together cohesively 

My experience was a frustrating one. Its difficult to make an assessment on whether its been valuable as the qualification has yet to yield any tangible results, but I certainly feel other education providers have left me far more satisfied and confident.",Person,,Luke Towers,https://uk.trustpilot.com/users/5f5775711181235573913a53,Thing,Avado,Organization,Trustpilot,https://uk.trustpilot.com,Rating,2

She was always kind and supportive the entire way even offering her own time to help if i needed. At times where i may have been slacking she boosted my morale and kept me on track being supportive and firm at the precise moments. At times where i had difficulty with work commitments with my apprenticeship work. Krutika really came through when I felt intimidated to voice my concerns to my employers who were supposed to also support me in my apprenticeship but was not! She made sure my issues were escalated appropriately and ultimately resolving the matter. Throughout my course i would always be asked at what level i think im performing at to which i always felt was to a merit level. Krutika would always reassure me that she believes im working at distinction level. Admittedly I thought we was only being kind by telling such. Rest assured you can trust Krutikas words as that IS what i achieved! To conclude for all the hurdles i may have come across in the Avado learning experience it is all compensated by the support you provided my Krutika.

138,Review,2020-06-27T13:49:21+00:00,L & D CIPD with Avado - A few regrets,en,"I would like to share my experience with Avado so far. For context, I am studying one of their L & D CIPD courses. 

Like many of the positive reviews here, the best experience I had was during the sales process. Informative, consultative, they did what they committed to and it felt like an easy decision to sign up. If the course was as effective as their sales process, I was very confident it would be a great experience. 

One important thing to note, is that you can only claim a refund 14 days after purchase. Often, you will not get access to the course or the materials until the cohort/class starts, and this can be sometime after making the payment. In other words, you could be in a situation where you will not be able to request a refund when you have seen the quality of the course. 

I requested a refund during my first module. At the time I knew it was unlikely this would be granted because I was familiar with their T's and C's and the small print. Their response was fair (citing the 14 day refund period) and they offered me the alternative of deferring my course, gifting it to someone else, or exploring another course instead. None of these options really help me, because it is the approach, content and service itself that I have an issue with. 

My top tip here is to read the terms & conditions and understand their policies on refunds before you make the buying decision. Consider if you are happy to lose that money if you subsequently decide that you are not enjoying the content or the course. 

A summary of my feedback on my experience so far: 

- Course structure. Sometimes very content-heavy, other times extremely light in content. In all honesty, there have been weeks where I thought listening to a podcast or reading a couple of relevant blog posts would have advanced my learning far more than this course. 

- Convoluted structure. Often, the course content lacks a clear structure or logical order. 

- There is far less interactive elements in the course than advertised. I was told to expect a live class nearly every week, but the reality is, you typically get 2 live classes every 6-8 week period. 

- The forums on the course site are  not moderated (with the exception of the assessment forum). This means that students (with a range of experience and knowledge) can share their views completely unchecked or properly moderated by a tutor. I question the value of this, and worry that if taken at face-value, some students may follow bad advice posted here. 

- The Tutor is very helpful, responsive and thorough in his follow-up and replies. However, his scope is limited (responding to questions about the assessments purely) and he is stretched extremely thin. He looks after two ""cohorts"". Our cohort has over 200 people in it, and I believe the other has a similar number. It must be a lot of hard work looking after that many students and it limits the meaningful contribution a tutor can make in the course. 

- The most recent module has been an utter shambles, and I worry that members of the cohort will suffer for this when it comes to assessment. There has been a complete mismatch for weeks between the Assessment that has been set, the grading criteria and the guidance that has been given. Essentially, a mix of old and new content that has confused a huge amount of students. The tutor has worked hard to apologise and rectify this, but this was not the tutor's fault and it is not good enough from a quality-control perspective at all.

In summary, the experience falls short of what I expected during my initial discussions with Avado about the course. I am also now trapped/stuck in a position where I have to commit to over 12 months of learning that I really would rather walk away from. At an investment of over 2,000 GBP, I don't feel I can simply walk away and write that amount off, especially during these times. 

So I am committed to a learning process which I am extremely unsatisfied with for a protracted amount of time. My hope is that it improves and I begin to enjoy the content/experience. If I do, I will happily reflect that experience here in a new review. Sadly, I don't hold out much hope for that at all.",Person,,Alex,https://uk.trustpilot.com/users/5e8edc60708bf8bcdeefbe65,Thing,Avado,Organization,Trustpilot,https://uk.trustpilot.com,Rating,2

159,Review,2020-05-29T18:52:58+00:00,Because a global pandemic isn’t enough!,en,"I’ve had one of the worse experiences with Avado so far!

I’ve registered to do a course with Avado to help me do my job and hopefully have a long career as I don’t have any qualifications related directly to my job. 

Unfortunately due the virus I lost my job in March, which is when my course was supposed to start! Frazzled and trying to get everything sorted quickly I completely forgot to cancel my course. 

When I sent emails to cancel Avado informed that I have to pay the course in FULL, despite the fact that I attended no classes and used no materials! I hadn’t even logged on the platform!! 

Now with no job, Avado has asked me to pay £100 to “halt” the process of raising the issue to a debt collection agency. 

For someone where their job depended mainly on bonuses and commission it is very difficult to make ends meet, still pay rent, bills and food. For a company who had to let go some of their employees you’d think that a global health crisis would be basis to contract termination!

I completely understand having to lose a deposit or paying an instalment, but paying for the full course which I did not use not once for a job I no longer have seems opportunistic, unpleasant and discourteous! 

I 100% do not recommend you use Avado unless you’re sure no other crisis would ever hit the world again!",Person,,Rand Ammary,https://uk.trustpilot.com/users/5ed159fa13f40a254537d43e,Thing,Avado,Organization,Trustpilot,https://uk.trustpilot.com,Rating,1

I had previously started this course with another online provider but I abandoned my studies because the course material and support were woefully inadequate. Therefore, I truly believe it is worth paying to study with Avado because the course material developed in conjunction with the CIPD is far superior to that of other providers. In addition, if you are lucky enough to be in Loretta McKay's cohort of learners, then I have no doubt that you too will succeed in completing the course. She manages in one tutor support session to demystify all of the learning material and distill it into a one-hour webinar that leaves you feeling empowered and able to take on the assignment. Throughout the 14-month course, I have felt that Loretta really cared if we were successful and when people were failing and needed the additional support, she was always available. I have no hesitation in recommending Avado as the right partner to support you on your learning journey!",Person,https://user-images.trustpilot.com/5e860820cb2c5d75a45473a2/73x73.png,Mrs  Hughes,https://uk.trustpilot.com/users/5e860820cb2c5d75a45473a2,Thing,Avado,Organization,Trustpilot,https://uk.trustpilot.com,Rating,5

Didn't explain at the time that wasn't all the costs. its another around £100 a year for a membership with AAT (without this you cant sit any exams) and then, each exam can cost anywhere between £70-£120 depending on how far you are willing to drive. Exams are 5 every level, so that's 5 times you've got to take a day off work for an exam - per year, and this isn't explained when you sign up to the course! it took me 18 months to do Level 2 as the tutors aren't much support or help. Its one bog standard learning centre for every student, they run live classes, which are at pm.... just as everyone gets in from work, and if you want to rewatch it you have to sit for an hour listening to the lecture and all the extra questions for everyone which is time consuming. Would never recommend to anyone. They also charge extra if you go over the 12 months they give you with barely any support. Really disappointed. Last thing, certificate doesn't even come from Avado, it comes from AAT, so essentially youre paying £2500 to Avado for them to send you some books so you can self teach!

To finish this off I would just like to say Perran works ridiculously hard to make sure everyone one of us passes, even as his work load increases. The work Perran has done with me has enabled me to finish my apprenticeship and even achieve a distinction.

However I have had signficant difficulties with AVADO following the completion of my qualification. In June of this year (2019) I completed my final module of the course and naturally assumed that this would result in my certification being processed in due order. I am now currently in the onboarding process for a new role that requires my certification and have found out that AVADO had failed to submit my details to CiPD until November, a full 5 months after completion. This will now likely result in a delay to my start date and financial difficulties because I am unable to start my job. AVADO's customer support teams are extremely difficult to get responses from.

I was told Avado do all of the above and paid in full and signed up. It was only on the first day when their systems went down that I called up and asked how long they would be down that I was told I had to wait for it to come back online which wasn't an issue but they made a slight joke about me needing to get used to the waiting of system as this is what I would have to do between units. When I questioned this I was told I would have to wait 6-8 weeks on some units until I could progress. This was certainly not my plan nor explained to me. I expressed to the dept manager I felt like I was mis-sold the course and cancelled down my agreement.

So i have called Avado explaining the situation and they just remained neutral saying I will lose my money if I will not continue with them. I have paid over £3000 for these courses and I can’t finish them. I have started studying level 3 online but I wasn't happy with the resources: no online classes available, no mock exams other than the once on AAT website and that took me extra time to study, time that I couldn’t spend learning for myself. I don't want to continue level 3& 4 with Avado and I asked for a refund but has been refused.

Nik C couldn't have done any more for me, honestly, he was so helpful and friendly and went out of his way to answer my queries. He's been a star for MONTHS helping me out! Thank you so much Nik!

I also think the price for CIPD L3 Diploma was amazing! It was discounted for September so I enrolled for January 2020 and saved over £600! That's HUGE for a single mother and will make such a difference to us! So thank you, Avado!

Avado also give you a 12 month NUS card for free. Every little helps :)

Jonathan described the course and all of its features and the support I would receive throughout. The information provided on the day was enough for me to feel confident to sign up to the course and when the time was right i dealt with the financial and induction process with Jonathan to enrol.

I was contacted first thing the following morning by phone with a follow up email. On returning her call, she was very pleasant, knowledgable in her field and patient. Nothing was too much trouble and she was perceptive in helping decide which level of the course would be right for me. Payment options were easy and quick and the relevant material came through straight away.  I've now had a really good look at how the course works on the visual learning system and cannot wait to get started. From what I have seen and experienced so far, the course looks easy to follow, has plenty of support if you need it and forums to chat to your peers.

641,Review,2019-09-06T11:50:29+00:00,Honor Holloway - BEST TUTOR EVER - VLC great experience,en,"It was a great experience to learn through the VLC and Avado, they make it so easy to digest and provide so much advise and help that you do not miss a regular F2F class at all! In fact, you choose when you can study and it is a lot easier to organise yourself. 

But what really made my learning experience was my tutor Honor Holloway. She was extremely supportive, making time for me when I needed it and always helping a lot! Her tutor support sessions were just brilliant, going, point by point, on all assessment requirements and making sure all of us were aware of what we needed to do and that we were comfortable with what was needed to meet and exceed the requirements so we could do a great job, always keeping the nice vibe and happy tone, and motivating us at all times. 
On a personal note, I had difficulties on a family level and Honor has always been there giving me the extra support and the understanding I needed twice over the course, especially coping with loss whilst trying to meet the assessment deadlines, juggling also with work, etc. She is a BRILLIANT person as well as an AWESOME tutor, and she is the 99% of those 5 stars of this review. If you get lucky enough to have Honor as your tutor, be sure YOU WILL LEARN SO MUCH, YOU WILL GET THE SUPPORT YOU MAY NEED, AND YOU WILL ENJOY THE PATH ALONG THE WAY. 
Thank you so much for this amazing experience learning with you, Honor! All the best!",Person,,Elisabet Chaves,https://uk.trustpilot.com/users/5d7248036fa365404713e4ec,Thing,Avado,Organization,Trustpilot,https://uk.trustpilot.com,Rating,5

They also don't cover the facts that Avado can change the service provision anytime they see fit apparently without giving the right to receive a refund for change of contract.

722,Review,2019-08-17T11:20:41+00:00,The AVADO CIPD Intermediate Certificate in Learning and Development is very poor value for money,en,"Having recently completed the AVADO CIPD Intermediate Certificate in Learning and Development, I believe the course is very poor value for money, because:
 
•	Lack of academic rigour – Much of the set / recommended content was very limited in depth / detail and often based on poor quality, unreliable sources. Peer-reviewed, academic / professional sources were provided during the course, but not consistently. Overall, input was limited in quantity and of poor quality. 

•	Poorly written course materials – Instructions were sometimes incoherent / not clearly articulated / missing.  There were at times very noticeable, basic grammar / spelling / punctuation mistakes. 

•	Basic, not very professionally constructed online learning platform – The online platform was adequate for the needs of the course, though there were obvious flaws, e.g. repeated (perhaps through inattentive copying and pasting) and missing sections (where a link would not work / lead to a nothing). The presentation of the in-house produced materials, including print and video content, was noticeably basic with at times obvious errors and inconsistencies. This point and the last were particularly surprising / disappointing / irritating, when one considers the cost of the course (see below). 

•	Limited response to participants’ outputs – Online discussion forums / tasks were set up on the online learning platform but for significant durations of the course, there was no feedback from the course tutor(s) on the participants’ contributions. Consequently, although participants did share experiences, opinions, ideas and resources (though their engagement appeared to drop as the course progressed), opportunities to signpost and build on this output were often neglected, i.e. without any response, or superficial. 

•	Poor coordination / communication – Basic / important course information, e.g. dates for webinars, was sometimes incorrect / not clearly articulated / not provided in a timely manner to course participants. 

•	Lack of / misleading information about cost of certificate – After payment for and the start of the course, participants were encouraged to become members of the CIPD and informed they had to be members in order to get the official CIPD certificate upon completion. The cost of this membership was £135 and it expired on the last day of the course. After the end of the course, participants were again informed they had to be members of the CIPD to get the official CIPD certificate, i.e. they had to pay again to get it, even if they were not interested in being a member of the CIPD any more (like me). The cost to renew the membership was £98. Either this information was not communicated to participants before the start of the course or it was not done so clearly enough. In the end, I decided not to buy the official CIPD certificate, because of my disappointment when I found out I was, in fact, not going to be issued with it unless I paid even more money, and because of my overall dissatisfaction with the course. 

When I consider overall these issues of quality, substance and clarity, along with the relatively very high cost of this course (£3,595) and that of other, similar study experiences I have completed, this is why I believe the AVADO CIPD Intermediate Certificate in Learning and Development is very poor value for money.",Person,,NS,https://uk.trustpilot.com/users/5d57e307500227ffef1af8cf,Thing,Avado,Organization,Trustpilot,https://uk.trustpilot.com,Rating,1

I was unaware that AVADO were going to be reaching out to me over the phone when I made an enquiry through CIPD and that is the only part of the process that I would recommend mending - having a bit more clarity on which company will reach out to you and the fact it will be over the phone.

Only negative is perhaps they should do a few more lecturers to reduce the ratio of reading to teaching. For people like myself, I learn a lot more from demonstration and illustration as oppose to simpy reading text.

One other slight negative is that the text pulled from text books for the online readkn is occasionally strangely ordered and I feel certain bits should be moved around to provide a more coherent/lineal learning path with reading.

It all makes sense in the end but you do find yourself going back to read some more complicated bits once you encounter the fundamental basics of it later on.",Person,,Michael,https://uk.trustpilot.com/users/5d5145c1bfd65b2007035d0f,Thing,Avado,Organization,Trustpilot,https://uk.trustpilot.com,Rating,4

the course is a lot to cover but they really do guide you through it and as long as you attend the tutor sessions (two for each unit) and pay attention to what they say then you should be fine.

I had delivered teacher training CPD sessions, but this course was an eye opener into the 'real world' of diagnosing needs, designing solutions, managing progress, and evaluating their success. I have found the content highly relevant, and the assessments made me think about my learning.

The case studies and reports were fascinating. I work in a completely different environment to the private sector. I originally started the course with the intention of leaving teaching, but the course has rekindled my love for what I do. It has helped me to get a new teaching job, as I was able to talk about elements of the course in my interview.

I know where I want my role to go and this course has helped me take those first steps.

My tutor, Joanna, was brilliant. She calmly responded to my many emails, and I felt like my contributions to webinars were valued. The webinars are excellent and very active, supporting the structured weekly activities. 

It's hard to study after work, but I actually ended up wanting to learn more about L&D. I feel like I've got a level of expertise in this that I can share. So, yes, it's not easy to shuffle your life. At times, something will have to give (in my case it was running, but I was injured anyway), but I think it's worth it.

800,Review,2019-07-29T20:24:49+00:00,Avado Experience,en,"Learning the level 3 CIPD HR practice through Avado has been a joy over the 9 month period. The format of weekly learning per unit, leading up to the assessment, allows students to find their best routine and ease into that comfortably and quickly - particularly if working full-time or having other commitments i.e. family. The regular knowledge testing and sharing of viewpoints among fellow students was particularly beneficial and helped a great deal in shaping ideas when serious thought and dedication was applied towards the assessment. The tutors were also fantastic, thoroughly supportive and positive, and I found their feedback for the assessments to be excellent. 
I would recommend Avado to anyone!",Person,,Alastair Shields,https://uk.trustpilot.com/users/5d3f5611d5316e619239fc49,Thing,Avado,Organization,Trustpilot,https://uk.trustpilot.com,Rating,5

853,Review,2019-07-15T18:16:58+00:00,"Astonishingly poor service, saved from a 1* review only by their easy online system",en,"I enrolled for the AAT2 accountancy certificate in July 2018. I received the books, and all of them were littered with errors - some grammatical and (to a degree) excusable, some with errors in the sequence of steps taken to arrive at the solution to a problem, and incorrect entry amounts. Avado are supposedly in the business of steering students away from such accounting errors.

I took it upon myself to suggest corrections, with a couple of ""thank yous"", no apology on the first few occasions until I pressed the point of paying nearly £1000 for dreadfully edited course materials. 

At one point I received ""yes, you are correct Alex, well done"". I didn't want recognition or condescension, I wanted accuracy in the first place. I asked them to reissue the texts with errors corrected. They said ""yes, certainly"", but nothing materialised.

If I were in their position, I'd be tripping over myself with an apology, and assurance of future corrections and an offer of a refund. I had to ask for one. They did not address it at all.

Thankfully, I didn't struggle with the concepts offered by this course. Avado must awaken themselves to the reality that there are some people who might struggle, and a single mis-placed word here or there could make all the difference to their level of understanding. Nothing was done, despite the clarity with which I expressed the need for this. 

I'm currently awaiting the result of my accounting software exam, which will be abysmal, as I was tested using a software I'd never seen before. Avado provided a redundant form of it, and no assessment centres offered tests using it, so I was reduced to learning (to me) a completely new software within the confines of an exam. I'd never run out of time in an exam until this point.

I didn't use the tutors at all. I just hoped or expected the course materials to be accurate and usable, far less to do their editing job for them (and see no positive result for myself of the rest of my cohort).

All details of the course I completed, and practice assessments I took, have vanished from my online dashboard. Thankfully it's not pivotal, and is honestly in line with the way they seem to treat their students. Just spit them out at the end.

It baffles me that in a profession where detail is key, there was such a staggering range and quantity of errors in the material, which were occasionally even ruinous to the ideas put forward.

The grammar, one might argue, is unimportant, but it reflects poorly on Avado as an official seat of learning to have committed such basic mistakes.

I don't think I hold my educational history to a higher standard than I should. You HAVE to be right on the money with course material, among other things, otherwise your reputation will suffer. I wouldn't normally do this, but I'm now in the business of outing them on review sites, so uninterested was their stance on things, in the hope that prospective students choose another provider and don't fall foul of similar maltreatment.

Atrocious customer service. They were just happy to take my money and do nothing to resolve my issues. For a subject in which accuracy is paramount, I found their attitude towards all of the above, and towards their own reputation, utterly dumbfounding.

In short, I won't use Avado again, and hope others don't either.",Person,https://user-images.trustpilot.com/5d2cc3073e3aa72341edf45b/73x73.png,Alex Fleming,https://uk.trustpilot.com/users/5d2cc3073e3aa72341edf45b,Thing,Avado,Organization,Trustpilot,https://uk.trustpilot.com,Rating,2

Although their platform looks professional and is easy to use, the content is less than desirable. A few typos and the assessment instructions are often unclear or misleading. The tutorials do not provide much more than the content you find online. The tutors also take a long time to reply to queries (although this, I am sure, is dependent on the tutor you are given).

Avado were the more expensive option compared to my local classroom-based courses, and because of the above issues, I do not feel the price is a true reflection of the quality of the product offered.

So far, I am finding the course work (textbooks, online content, quizzes ) - all really easy to follow and cleverly constructed.  However, there are some grammar mistakes in their book work. That might seem ridiculous to comment on, but it really drives me crazy when a profesional educator hasn’t checked their work enough to notice... we are paying them money to educate us after all (and I’m no grammar whiz myself)!  The other reason I am only giving 3 stars is because I expected the course to be way more personal... I have been studying for nearly a month and haven’t had any one personally contact me to make sure I have everything I need/am getting on okay... I am doing the course faster then their laid out plan... meaning the forums that the tutor starts are irrelevant to me, and so are the live classes (you can watch recordings of past live classes but that doesn’t help if you have a question).

All in all, I’m still happy that I have chosen to study with them, as I think I’m still probably learning better with their interactive online content then I would if I was just self pace studying with AAT textbooks.  But thought I would write an honest review to help readers understand what they get.",Person,,Kate ,https://uk.trustpilot.com/users/59ce49da0000ff000acf100f,Thing,Avado,Organization,Trustpilot,https://uk.trustpilot.com,Rating,3

You can’t complete the course entirely on your own, you will need to enlist the help of either colleagues or family and friends. The subject matter is so simple, it should really be a multiple choice exam. But they insist on very lengthy and elaborate assignments which to all intents and purposes may as well be a dissertation.

I informed him that i had delay to respond coz i have I.T challenges and was waiting for an I.T person to help.

1155,Review,2019-05-02T13:54:08+00:00,Absolutely horrendous experienc,en,"Horrendous experience from the start.

I would not recommend studying with Avado. I was sold this course on the pretense it would be very flexible, I work full time for the ambulance service meaning my hours are not structured and also incurring long over runs, not finishing on time and unable to maintain a structured studying time frame. There have been a multitude of errors been made by the provider. There are lots of grammatical and numerical errors in the books. The online tests sometimes have the wrong answers even though you have answered correctly (confirmed by my tutor that my answer is correct and the system is wrong). I turned up to one exam and the exam center had moved to another town, I was not informed of this. When I complained I was told I was sent an email, I thoroughly checked through all my emails, inbox, junk, trash etc - this email was no where to be found. I turned up to another exam and the exam had not been booked with the exam center, luckily they had a space and let me sit my exam. I turned up to another exam and they had not paid for my exam therefore I had to wait until the exam center had spoken to Avado who confirmed they would pay for it. 

Now I have one more exam remaining and due to my full time full on work commitments I have been unable to study. I rang avado to find out how long I would have access to the online platform, they advised it would expire at the end of July and if I wanted to access it after that it would be around £45 per month (even though I paid upfront for my studying and my last exam had not yet been sat). I do not understand why this fee is so high. This is not the flexible studying I was promised. I was informed on the phone that I was told at the time of my purchase the online studying would expire, this is not true. I have nothing in writing to confirm there would be an end date to my course.

My 3rd year will absolutely not be with this company and I would urge others to explore other options before committing to this study. I know others feel the same from talking to my peers on the course and speaking with people prior to going into exams, they have all experienced the same issues. 

This is not a good enough service for the money paid.",Person,,Grace Harris,https://uk.trustpilot.com/users/5b1136864de5666d34e19de7,Thing,Avado,Organization,Trustpilot,https://uk.trustpilot.com,Rating,1

1201,Review,2019-03-10T12:18:27+00:00,AVOID BY ALL COSTS!!!,en,"This is the THE WORST experience in my entirely life with a studies.
It's first started with a lovely lady on the phone promising how incredible was the course and basically ""selling"" it to me. I was sure this will be the best customer service support as the lady was so informative and attentive. The lady on the phone was called Barbara, and I wish she NEVER called me in my life now...But as long as I applied for the course it turned out to be completely opposite!
I started my HR level 3 course in September, as I'm full time working and I left university as I really struggled with money but wanted to get a good qualification I thought AVADO will be the best option how wrong I was...The course structure looked interesting and I was sure the tutor and lessons will be as good. But the course turned out to be VERY poor and tutors were...well, just unhelpful I would say at least. I was told I can't cancel my contract, but I would do that in October with a big pleasure, so I was still FORCED to pay huge amount of money, even thought I explained I am physically struggling to do so. As their manager still couldn't agree with cancelling my contract I thought of changing course to Digital Marketing, hoping it will be better structured and more useful. But was mistaken again. You are not even getting a professional qualification which can be recognised. Is more like of ""coursera"" course but costs a lot of money. I was basically in situation, where I have no choice but keep study, as money will be taken from my account anyway. So I switch back to HR course to start ""from scratch"" it was a new tutor and everything was promising to be better. My course started in January and I also had to pay extra £150 or so, because I had to ""re-do it"" all over again...So my digital classroom was with a lot of bags and I had no access to full studies and couldn't get in touch for  my tutor or anyone at all. Student services were replying once or two per week with something like ""someone will be in touch with you shortly"" so I end up with failing my first assignment deadline as when they kind of fixed my classroom, I couldn't catch up with ALL of the material I missed to quickly. Now I have no idea what am I supposed to do... I feel like crying and screaming as I am in a very difficult finance situation and since September I gained ZERO knowledge of support, I only paid £2,5k for NOTHING. Completely to the air...I wish someone to cancel this hell of the contract I had to sign and fully refund me all the money I paid for THE NONSENSE....Looks like I need to find a lawyer with this case,as I have a full right too get a refund, when I gate NO service at all. EVERYTHING they promised was THE SCUM... first time in my life I was fooled and disappointed like that...",Person,https://user-images.trustpilot.com/5c850017f46be32c3036c6ff/73x73.png,Kristine Novika,https://uk.trustpilot.com/users/5c850017f46be32c3036c6ff,Thing,Avado,Organization,Trustpilot,https://uk.trustpilot.com,Rating,1

2. TUTOR KNEW NOTHING ABOUT THE COURSE - The tutor taught the class little to nothing and we even forced to form a Watsapp group for supporting each other which was all the student on the course, all 40+ constantly remarking how terrible the tutor was at teaching.

3. TUTOR WAS RUDE - The tutor would say rude and dismissive comments and would favor certain students particular students of a certain gender. Additonally although the cost of the course was £3000 several people decided to leave based on how our tutor acted. 

4. INCORRECT COURSE MATERIAL - The course would often provide guidelines that were needed to complete assignments for the course then assessors would fail the assignment for using their guidelines.

5. NO CERTIFICATE - After completing the course, they delayed issuing the entire classes certificates for 3-6 months due to being poor planning and even cost some of my classmate's promotions/jobs.

Overall they are the worst company I have ever experience for any qualification in the market.

There were a few teething problems with the web site now and again but these were addressed quickly.
One word of warning , do not underestimate the amount of work and time needed for the course (about 10-15 hours a week).

1279,Review,2019-01-19T17:15:15+00:00,I am currently studying for the CIPD Level 5 Human Resource Management Diploma,en,"I am currently studying for the CIPD Level 5 Human Resource Management diploma. I was nervous about using an online provider, particularly at this level. My last study was 30+ years ago and I was anxious about not have a face to face tutor or 'classroom'.  
However, Avado are especially good at helping you when you are stuck. I have a dedicated tutor (Honor Holloway) who is very good at responding to my urgent pleas for assistance when I am stuck, which for me are usually late at night. She has often called me the next day. It is very helpful to discuss the course and assignments with her to make sure I am on the right track and she gives me real support, helping me work through any problems myself so I fully understand what the assignments are requiring and empowering me. There are also students discussion forums where we help support each other if confused. Avado also offers real-time tutor+Group sessions which are incredibly helpful and the online campus is really easy to navigate. 
My only concern is the amount of time I need to study. I work full time and was told I'd need around 8 hours a week study. This is actually more like double that which is hard with a full time job and 3 kids.  I have put my social life on hold for a year and have a very understanding husband!  Having said all that, it's a great way to get a proper qualification whilst still working full time. I am a perfectionist and perhaps I do spend too much time studying but I have a thirst for success and fear of failure which keeps me driven. I would recommend Avado to study a CIPD qualification for anyone that is working full time and doesn't have the money or time to be able to go back to uni or college. Avado are completely up to date on all current HR thinking and have extremely strong links with the CIPD. The content is very relevant and incredibly interesting and the finance options are very affordable, with easy monthly payments spread over 12 - 36 or more months.",Person,,Wendy Kirman,https://uk.trustpilot.com/users/5b6ec2454de5666d34fa1172,Thing,Avado,Organization,Trustpilot,https://uk.trustpilot.com,Rating,5

1289,Review,2019-01-11T15:17:25+00:00,Rather disappointing at the moment - lets hope it improves!,en,"So far my experience with Avado has been mediocre, and is swiftly becoming very disappointing. When you have been promised 12 months free membership to the CIPD, 3 months free access to HR Inform, and have paid £3,595.00 upfront for an online course, you expect what was offered. 

The situation - Course begins 5 November 2018 and runs until January 2020. Membership card from the CIPD arrives saying it expires on 1 July 2019, this is only 8 months free membership. Queried with Avado on 17/12/18 by telephone and it was verbally confirmed I get 12 months free membership and I must phone the CIPD. When speaking to a representative at the CIPD I discover their membership runs from June to June each year, and that Avado are aware of this. I email Avado on 17/12/18 querying if they will honour the four missing months (12 months free clearly shows on their invoice) I receive no response and have to chase them up on 02/01/19. I then received the following response: ""I have raised this with our Quality and Compliance team to listen to your original enrollment call to understand what you were sold. This is because it is our understanding that CIPD membership can be given for up to 12 months long.""

I then receive a response stating: ""After looking further into your account I could see that the CIPD membership fees have been confirmed with us to be paid and the 4 months are being honored.""

I then reply back requesting how they will honour the additional four months free membership and receive this response: ""I can confirm that your membership has been paid for up until June which is the renewal date for memberships.""

If you're going to honour the twelve months free membership that you have promised, tell me how you plan to reimburse me for the four months from July to October 2019 that you offered but hasn't been included!

Now lets move on to the HR Inform three month free subscription - they didn't bother to add the essential caveat that this is in fact not free at all - if you want the three free months, you have to pay for a 12 month subscription and you will then get 3 of those months for free.

Now lets move on to the Avado learning platform. It is glitchy and temperamental. You sign in with your username and there is a tickbox option to remember your username. Despite ticking this each time... your username is never remembered and you have to re-type it every single time you log in. 

Throughout the course there are discussion groups and in order to see others responses, you have to first post your response. You do this - and the platform then acknowledges you've done this but you're unable to view anyone else's response. You have to physically go back a day or more later before it allows you to see these. When you have limited time as it is, this is not useful!

Dates don't appear correctly on these and on the forums.

The course content - there are spelling and grammatical errors throughout. Yes, I know not everyone works to a standard of perfection, however when we are warned that our course submissions must be spell checked, I would have thought they would follow their own advice with the course content.

The group taking the course is large, which means they have split us down into smaller groups (even though this is all done online!) and as such, you don't get to read or learn from others experience on the question and answer forums, which I find extremely disappointing. I want to be able to read all the answers, not a select few from those who bother to do them (many don't) and from a small group of only +/- 23 people that they randomly select to place you with on a unit).

Each Unit consists of ""lessons"" which are made up of quizzes, reading, further research, question and answer forums, etc, which is great. If you click on one of the lessons, it automatically shows on the dashboard as being completed, despite the fact that you have in actual fact not finished it. It can be a little frustrating when you're interrupted and have to go back and find where you left off (this doesn't apply to every single individual ""lesson"").

Assessments - you are required to use Harvard Referencing which is fair enough. It is however an extremely steep learning curve for those of us who have never used it before. Links to resources were supplied, however I still had to do more research and then ask friends who have used Harvard referencing before for some guidance. Still not feeling that confident about whether I am using it correctly or not. Feedback from your assessments is helpful, although it leaves you with questions you don't know how to get answers to. 

On the positive side, the course content is informative and I appreciate how the ""lessons"" are broken down into segments with time required to complete - this is really useful.

I also have to add that if it wasn't for the fact that my CIPD membership and my query regarding it has been handled so badly, I wouldn't have bothered typing such an in-depth review.

18/01/19 - I do appreciate the proactive and quick response I have received from my review, thank you. I look forward to the improvements and appreciate the good customer support I have received.",Person,,Bronwen,https://uk.trustpilot.com/users/5c38b3851b9657801a74d0f1,Thing,Avado,Organization,Trustpilot,https://uk.trustpilot.com,Rating,3

The organisation is poor. Course material is littered with mistakes (which makes things difficult when working with numbers that don't add up ). Classes tend to drop off after the first few weeks and aren't engaging in the slightest.  

I did all my learning through the AAT website which you pay membership for and didn't bother doing my second year. I didn't inform AVADO that i'd decided to not continue and haven't heard anything from them since and didn't even receive the course material for the second year anyway. 

A waste of money that you won't get back. I would recommend doing your research before getting involved.

(UPDATE.)

So AVADO rang me in the evening of their reply to my Trustpilot review. Strange that it takes a review in the public domain for them to action anything. 
Gent asked me on the phone if there was anything they could do to re engage me but its a little too late. I had asked for refund in previous complaints for my second year of study because the course was not up to standard and kept on getting the terms and conditions thrown at me. One of the terms is that you have 14 days after purchase to cancel if you wish and I was informed that if I wasn't happy with course material and mistakes that I should have stated within these 14 days. The terms make no sense. I hadn't received all the material at this point... and if you're learning a subject how are you meant to go through course materials and check for errors when you haven't learnt the content yet. I never even received the level 3 course material so couldn't have checked that for mistakes. More importantly, you don't expect something that you fork out a couple of grand for to have mistakes.

Logging on for the first time was quite daunting, but I had a really great tutor (Andy Murphy) who has helped me, patiently, with my frequent questions and queries. The course was 6 assignments which were between 6-8 weeks each. I would say I spent about 8 hours a week on the coursework and writing assignments (more on the last one as it seemed to be a lot more intensive than the others - Employment Law). Sometimes it was hard going, but as Andy said there's no point doing a course if you aren't learning or challenging yourself. Now that I have finished I can appreciate that comment more!
Avado was really good at keeping information flowing and Andy was always contactable and replied really quickly to my direct emails. 
I found the tutor sessions the most helpful - some of the wording on the assignments (set by CIPD) seems so confusing when you first see it, but the tutor sessions definitely helped clarify what was needed. I would have been stuck without them!

The tutor was great and answered all of my queries promptly and was very helpful but I wouldn’t have had so many queries or wasted as much time if there wasn’t so many errors (and I mean loads of errors) in the weekly assessment questions/answers.

1358,Review,2018-11-03T13:30:10+00:00,Avoid AVADO,en,"My tutor was rude and brusque and rarely responded to queries with complete answers, I constantly had to go back for clarification. .

The only way to get a helpful response in time was to say I was going on holiday and needed a response ASAP. If I didn't do that, he would respond the day my assignment was due in, which meant that I would fail because I didn't get his feedback until in time. 

I tried to complain to student services, and their service was very poor. They were totally unempathetic and said that no one else had complained and that he was a really popular tutor. I responded I knew others had complained because they had told me that they too had a lack of adequate guidance and that they had. Student services tried to make me speak to my tutor, and I explained I didn't feel comfortable with that because he was so rude and dismissive on the video/skype-like tutorials, and emails, and they still tried to push it and said they'd ""look into it"". Neither I , nor any of my cohorts did get any help.

The most frustrating thing was when I received a very rude email from my tutor, and I forwarded it to student services explaining how upsetting this was, and that I didn't feel comfortable dealing with him because of his rudeness. They just forwarded it back to my tutor, who then sent me a defensive email telling me to call him if I had a problem. 

His abrupt and bullying attitude was stressful and intimidating, and many of my fellow students also complained about this. AVADO did nothing to help, and were obstructive, defensive, and unempathetic. 

I've completed several similarly set up courses, and Avado were by far the worst. I would definitely encourage avoiding them.


Edit: 5 November

Thanks for the offer Victoria.

I don't wish to relive a very stressful experience. I complained on 3 or 4 occasions over 11 months, and at no point was I taken seriously or given any empathy or understanding. The time I should have been listened to was the time of the original complaints, and not just when I posted my review of the poor service I received.

If AVADO do want to address these issues, I suggest they listen to their customers when concerns are raised, and not many months later because of a review. As I was not listened to on many occasions I'm sure you understand why I don't wish to rehash it again.",Person,,Emma,https://uk.trustpilot.com/users/5bdda2e220bc25abc1174b95,Thing,Avado,Organization,Trustpilot,https://uk.trustpilot.com,Rating,1

I only had one late payment of a day on a phone bill and despite having a mortgage and many other bills which have been paid on time for the past six years I was refused the monthly payment option.

Add to this the fact I had spoken to an advisor prior to choosing the course explained my education level and was advised this would be the correct course imagine my surprise when my tutor told us this was a University degree level course. Bit higher than I am used to by some margin as I don’t think NVQ Carpentry & construction is quite degree level. After having to take a one month break from studies due to serious injury it was hard to get started again. Not just because of the break but the total mismanagement by student services. After 6 months of them saying we will activate your studies again soon I FINALLY managed to get my course restarted but it was not only the wrong module it wasn’t at the start I was already a month behind after several attempts at getting things restarted properly & a curt ‘it’s not our problem’ I gave up as I was utterly confused as to where I was course wise.

Having originally enrolled with Home Learning College everything started well, but with paying over £7k for a top level qualification the support and level of service was never there once Avado took over.  Very high drop out rate in the cohort due to changing course leads on numerous occasions throughout the 2 years of study.  Very unhelpful, new staff placed, extremely rude tutors in some modules, the list is endless...save yourself some money and shop around, other providers cost less and actually care about their students. It says it all, that they are no longer offering the qualification...maybe because they can't deliver and many paid for a full qualification only to have to reduce to a lesser certificate as insufficient student support was provided.",Person,,J Hall,https://uk.trustpilot.com/users/5bae40024de5666d347c3a10,Thing,Avado,Organization,Trustpilot,https://uk.trustpilot.com,Rating,1

When I called in June to ask about the  CIPD  course,  the calls were never ending and I  could not  have  asked for a more friendly  bunch  of  people.  I signed up and was not told that  I  would be  financed for this course through a loan company.  I stupidly filled  in  the  forms and  started the course.  When I started having personal issues and  wanted to  put my course on hold, I  could not get hold of anyone! Call after call was ignored and emails were not responded to  in spite of  an automated  email saying that  I  would get a response  in 3 days. A month on and I  called again and managed to get through  a person  called Jonathan.  I was told that  I would  need to  get  someone else to  do  my course as I  cannot cancel due to  the  14 day right to cancel period having expired.  My frustration  is that how could I  cancel if no one picked up my calls? I  then asked  about  deferral and Jonathan  seemed surprised  at the prospect.  This is  the advise  my tutor gave me when I  called her to explain  why I  could not  continue  with the course. Jonathan  asked me to  email student services explaining that  I  wanted to  defer the course. When I  asked  about cancelling ,  he said I needed to  call the Finance  Company.  I called the finance company  and  was informed that they had paid Avado the full amount  for the  course and that I now owed them the money. I  was told that  I would only get a refund  if Avado allowed this ie Avado would need to  refund them what they paid on my behalf.  I  was recently  diagnosed  with  breast cancer and when I  signed up for the course I honestly thought  I  could handle doing the course and working.  The stress has however proven to be too much  as I also had to  change jobs recently.  All of this has meant that  I  can't continue with the course and a little  bit of  understanding  would have been appreciated and not reading out company  policy  of a script.  It is a pity that I  have  to air my problems on such a public platform  but I have been left with no  choice  as another week has gone by after my last correspondence  and I  am still waiting.  Surely everything  can't be  so black and white especially  as Avado has gone back on its word to respond  to queries within 3 working days.

1422,Review,2018-08-30T18:31:00+00:00,Study elsewhere if you value your time and sanity,en,"Awful. 
Note that the majority of the reviews are based on enrolment; and they're right. Avado are very eager to sign you up. I actually enquired about my CIPD level 3, but somehow got persuaded into signing up to Level 5 even though I'd never worked in HR. I was told that the course could be completed by committing 6hrs per week. 
I'm currently averaging 20 hours per week. 
Why? Because the course material is severely lacking. Referencing is a nightmare and the tutors are broken records, repeating the same sentence no matter how many times someone says ""I don't understand"". I STILL haven't found a reference for Ulrich's 3-legged stool that matches the one quoted in the material... and in the second assignment, my tutor gave the instruction ""the reference is really hard to find so just use 'Author (date)' and it'll be fine"". If the reference is THAT hard to find, it shouldn't be core material... and the person marking the assignment DID pick up on it. 
Assignment 3, and the questions (""assessment criteria"") aren't in the same sequence as the course weeks... the theory being that you can start your assignment as you study through the weeks...  but part of the second question I've JUST discovered in week 5. THREE WEEKS of wondering what it was referring to, and TOTALLY misunderstanding (the chat transcript said ""This is an easy one"", so I just assumed I was overthinking it. NO. 
This course has been massively stressful and had a hugely negative impact on my life and health. Not because the course is difficult, but because the material provided is insufficient, unclear, unreferenced (there's not even a clear index to find exactly where information is!!) and the support is slow and indifferent. Unless you don't work during office hours... then you might get a quick response. 
I have two colleagues studying their CIPD 5 & 7 with other institutions, and they don't face these problems. If you want your CIPD qualifications, look elsewhere.",Person,,Sam G,https://uk.trustpilot.com/users/5b8837ca4de5666d345bb813,Thing,Avado,Organization,Trustpilot,https://uk.trustpilot.com,Rating,2

Student Services are pretty much non existant - they are certainly not a 'service'. Emails never get responded to at all. I have sent so many emails that have not even been acknowledged with a 'sorry we are busy and we will get back to you' kind of email, you just get nothing back. Or there was an occaision where I emailed as I needed help relating to an exam I was due to take - this one got responded to but weeks later after I had already taken the exam! There are some incorrect and conflicting answers on their online tests where their book says one thing and the tests say another thing. My exams were included in the course fee but they stopped using my local exam centre half way through my course so since then I've had to pay myself and claim the money back and this takes a minimum of about a month - both times only after I have emailed and called to chase it up too, not actually done of their own accord! If you call them then you are always on hold for at least about 10 minutes and then when they do pick up they are so unhelpful. I would give 0 stars for customer service - the only reason I have given 2 stars is because the layout of the course in weekly training is good and the live classes were helpful (if you had one of the good tutors which I was lucky enough to have!). The sales team will be very quick to respond to you and seem very helpful but don't get pulled in by this, because as soon as you've paid and it gets moved from Sales to Student Services then you get nothing.

**EDIT** Avado have replied to my review but student services have STILL not replied to my email!

I am able to alternate my study days each week to fit around my schedule so I have a good study/life balance. The online activities clearly lead me through what I need to learn and are actually quite enjoyable as there are little animations and interactive sections. 
My tutor is very responsive to emails and sends continuous emails to us all, alongside online tutor sessions to cover any grey areas or trickier points to understand.
Overall I am really enjoying the course and the practical element to the activities and assessment is enabling me to input what I am learning into my role as well.",Person,,Rachel Greaves,https://uk.trustpilot.com/users/5b69afa84de5666d34225123,Thing,Avado,Organization,Trustpilot,https://uk.trustpilot.com,Rating,5

When you sign up you have 14 days to change your mind, regardless of the start date of your cohort. Once the course started and I realised it was totally inappropriate I called Avado. After being on hold for quite some time I was told to email what I had said in and in some cases they would be able to remove me from the course, this I was told would take 3 days. 
I call a few days later and I was on hold every time, once for an hour. I gave up. The next day a member of the Avado team told me they had been on an away day, so nobody was answering the phones. 
After yet another day of waiting, I was told it would take 8 weeks! To investigate. I said this was unacceptable and within a few days was told I could not withdraw from the course. 
Obviously this seems ridiculous as I did not have full access to the content until I started the course, I can only presume they want people to sign up the week before the cohort starts? 
I have now spent over £3000 on a course I do not wish to partake in, but they will not assist in any way. 
I emailed the Manager of student services during this whole incident and didn’t even receive an acknowledgement, which really demonstrates their customer service priorities.

However the problems start once you have actually signed up, they don't seem to follow the concepts they teach. I am studying a level 5 certificate in HR management, I am learning about communication, being open and transparent and how to deal with issues as they arise. None of this is on display at Avado.

The course materials have grammatical errors, some modules are diabolical while others contain errors that require deciphering from the tutor. Generally, I rarely use the online materials they provide, its often much easier to find alternative sources of information, as they actually define and explain ideas well.

The tutor is hired on a part-time basis, but feels like we are a burden to her life. Sessions with her are usually about clarifying the online materials or what the assessment questions actually mean. There is no teaching provided whatsoever. 

I participated in a feedback session with the company and they were ""very interested"" in my feedback. Offered to request further details from me - this was 3 months ago - I still have not heard a peep from them even after I reminded them. They have no real interest in what you have to say, but I am positive I will get some generic PR blurb reply stating ""we are always interested in our students feedback and so sorry blah blah"". 

Avado have  a great business model, they take on about 60 students paying over £3k for a course and then happily cut corners wherever possible. You are not provided with any meaningful tools, their learning hub has some interesting features and looks very polished. But thats where all the investment went.

I've hated doing my course through Avado.

Initially I wanted to do a level 3 but was pressured to do a level 5 as my degree meant it was 'more my level', but this course is incredibly difficult if you don't work within the industry.

The courses are labelled with the wrong dates from Alston year, units are mixed up in a misguided attempt at being useful, however no explanations for this. You can't see a percentage of your pass rate, the submission calenders are empty without events etc.

You can only use this site on a recent version of Windows, as the 'flexible' course is not available on any other devices. Something to bear in mind, as Adobe Connect (the high usage program required to watch the live videos) with consume slot of your computer's usage until it becomes a frozen typewriter.

The complaints/enquiries proceeded is really poor. I spent my lunch breaks on hold, only to be transferred to an unknown answer machine, and emails get replied to significantly late.

I really regret doing my course with Avado.

The reason I havent given 5 star is because I havent started the course yet and would like to see whats in store before rating full marks.",Person,,Kim,https://uk.trustpilot.com/users/5aaa13ad4de5666d3498ad60,Thing,Avado,Organization,Trustpilot,https://uk.trustpilot.com,Rating,4

I registered for my course and began in January 2018 and have definitely made the right decision.  The tutor's knowledge is excellent and the level of assistance provided to students if required is of the highest standard.  The VLC is a very good learning platform and well structured.

1620,Review,2018-01-24T20:21:15+00:00,Poor quality study materials and expensive,en,"I have done Level 2 Bookkeeping distance learning with Avado.
My first initial experience with costumer service and the signing up procedure was actually alright.
I had received an introduction email from my tutor when i started and that was about it. I had no further contact with her as i have not needed her support. 
Every so often if i have not logged  into my VLC for some time, i have received an email from her but it wasn't a personalized email only an automated, generic email with the same subject ""we haven't seen you for a while...""
Due to my personal circumstances i fall behind  my studies but i was doing OK. Of course, i have given an estimated 6 months to complete my course. I assumed it (obviously wrongly) that if i finish a month or so later it wouldn't be a big deal. Well, it was as I have been cut off and denied access to my online studies at the beginning of month 7, only weeks before my final exam. 
After calling  the college and paying an additional £45 fee for another month access i was able to log in again and revise for my exam. 
I had no response to any of my emails i have sent to them regarding this matter. The brilliant costumer service was only brilliant at the beginning until they have taken the payment but they were no where near us brilliant to deal with complains. 
My mailbox was flooded with their weekly newsletters and live class alerts loads of them which was not even relevant to my level2 course or class. But i have NOT ONCE received an email to remind me that my initial 6 months studying period is coming to an end nor to remind me to ask for extension if i want to carry on studying. 
Perhaps all these conditions were in the contract with small print and i have fail to read them. Possible. Still, i think along with the hundreds of newsletters they could of schedule in a reminder email too.
The whole experience left me feeling rather bitter so i have decided to sign up with a different college to do Level 3.

I am so pleased i did! 
I have not only received an introducing email from my tutor (they are in fact a group of 3 and not only 1 person) but had to have a personal induction with them to set my goals and study plan.
Now, that i have a comparison i can honestly say that not only Avado`s general support but also their  study materials are  very poor! 
I wish i had the study material for L2 what i have now. It would of made it so much easier for instance to understand the basic principles of double entry, just to mention one subject.
The 2 books i got were the same as the study content on VLC, dry and long texts with no extra workbook.
Honestly, do your research and compare the prices before you sign up with any college. There are many better once than Avado.",Person,,Erika Varga,https://uk.trustpilot.com/users/5a5bb0320000ff000b00e40a,Thing,Avado,Organization,Trustpilot,https://uk.trustpilot.com,Rating,1

1654,Review,2017-12-14T19:40:18+00:00,Don't be fooled by the star ratings - read the comments,en,"I'm close to completing a level 5 diploma with Avado and it has not been a good experience. A lot of the learning materials are good but AVADO could put those on line and give access to them for a fraction of the cost for what is supposed to be an interactive experience. I've paid almost 4 1/2 K for this course because its supposed to be a supported and interactive on-line experience. In reality I've found the support to be generally poor  - though there have been exceptions to this. When I've asked questions I've generally had quite superficial answers or no answer at all - even where I've been drawing attention to a wider problem that needs resolving on the site. There are forums which often are not monitored so delegates are asking questions and raising issues with the site that either don't get answered or  are not answered for weeks - by which time assessment deadlines are looming.  One of the main issues is that the material is recycled from previous courses - which is not a problem in itself - but it doesn't seem to be reviewed or updated in the interim. So for example it might ask you to answer a question and say that the definitive answer will be posted in a weeks time.  The answer then doesn't go up because current AVADO staff haven't reviewed the materials so don't  realise that they need to post an answer.   They also don't review group exercises to realise when they are not working so they can flex to the current situation - even when delegates are posting to say the exercise isn't working. They just seem to put the materials up there  - which is why I suggest they could be honest with people and not pretend its interactive and just charge people less.  In the last module they published 3 different dates on the site in 3 different places for the assessment submission then ended up having to give everyone an extension at the last minute because of this. In this module there was an error with the date of the first live class. For the second live class no tutor turned up. When someone posted that they couldn't get on they were advised they could watch the recorded version of the class without realising that the class hadn't actually taken place. So the link posted actually went to a blank classroom  - but AVADO hadn't realised this. Several people made comments on this but there was no response from AVADO until they were sent a screen shot of the empty classroom - at which point they posted a link to a recording to what they said was a previous version of the class that should have run - but was the wrong class - it was in fact an older recording of the class we had already had. In terms of the live class that should have taken place we were told that 'there had been confusion over the scheduling'. Again it took a couple of further comments for AVADO to realise the mistake and put up a previous version of the right class. The option to attend a live interactive session seems to have been taken off the table.  I think its not the mistakes that are the main issue here. Its AVADO'S inability to quickly investigate the issue in any depth so that issues are quickly put right. Instead their initial response is superficial, sometimes rude and unprofessional and takes no account of the fact that many delegates are busy people holding down jobs, running families and trying to fit in course work as and when only to find that the resources and support are not there or up to scratch when they need them. 

Its interesting that AVADO gets such high scores on this site but if you look at the comments  a lot of them are from new people who have just signed up. So what they are commenting on is the sign up process - the bit where AVADO put resources in - the sales pitch to get people signed up and get the money in. After that in my experience it doesn't really  deliver.",Person,,Isobel Vella,https://uk.trustpilot.com/users/596a126f0000ff000aafa824,Thing,Avado,Organization,Trustpilot,https://uk.trustpilot.com,Rating,1

Errors in all of the physical books, errors on the online knowledge checks.  Tutors who don't respond. Exams not booked in properly.  It's hard to pin point something that was right with this course.

I even did my final exam which was riddled with problems.  I did that at the beginning of September, got confirmation of my pass on the 19th October (which I had to look elsewhere for resources to actually help me to learn) and I am still waiting for Tutor Marked assignments to actually be marked back from August.

Keep emailing student services and the tutors and you don't get a response, even when you do they say they are going to sort it and then don't.

The amount of errors riddled in this entire course, along with the other levels as well is outrageous.  Most of the studying comes from working out where THEY have gone wrong and trying to work back from there, along with buying materials from elsewhere to help you learn.

DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY WITH THESE PEOPLE.

1731,Review,2017-10-19T16:17:15+00:00,Disappointed,en,"I am finishing now a course with them and I'm quite disappointed in the experience.
You're supposed to learn at your own pace but although they take your money, you have to wait a few months before you can start the course.
When I asked my tutor for information about the course like the time I had to complete it and the deadline for the exams she told me to check the introductory live class. That class didn't have any of the information I asked for.( to this day I haven't got any of that information) It would have been so much helpful if I would have known about the resources on the aat website! They pressure you to buy the membership but they don't bother to give you more info.You may wonder why I didn't look into it: I only had a full time job, 6 days a week and my university. That's why I paid so much money to have information on a ""plate"", a hustle free experience.

They put me in the same group as the accounting students (I've signed up for bookkeeping) which means I got all their updates..it got confusing at times.
During the course I received 2 emails suggesting that I was behind the studying schedule although, like I said before, its supposed to be learning at your own pace. 

I never had time to join live classes. Apparently there are recordings. I could never find them. After I looked for the links everywhere I decided to ask student services for them and no one bothered to give them to me. They only told me where they are supposed to be...

From what I understand tutors in other companies check your progress and your knowledge checks results and they recommend to you if you should take the exam or practice more. None of that here. After a while you get a 'auto response' type of email saying you should request your exam... there should be a lot more help from the tutors especially for people like me who decided to try something new ..
Should I mention the mistakes in the material and in the knowledge checks? 

Before I decided to write this I read other reviews. Everyone is happy with the way avado approached them in the beginning. I was happy as well but let's be honest here: those are just marketing strategies...

I'll leave you with the latest news from them: it takes 16 WEEKS for your diploma to be sent out!!",Person,,Alexandra ,https://uk.trustpilot.com/users/59e8d0090000ff000ad71577,Thing,Avado,Organization,Trustpilot,https://uk.trustpilot.com,Rating,2

I have spent many hours trying to reach an agreeable outcome but suffer slow response rates and also the inability to acknowledge the proof I send through as back up to my points.

As a person who was unsure of which course to take, I recieved lots of helpful advice on which course would be best for my circumstances, additionally I was given advice as to the career opportunities that would be available to me with each course - which was significant in aiding my final decision to enrol on level 5.

I'm self funded and had to find a course that could work around my job. This definitely fits the bill. You have to be disciplined but everything you need to complete the course is in the course content or on the CIPD website. You have to become a student CIPD member to complete the course and to access the materials on the CIPD website but it's worth the money. You can also get your student discount card (NUS) as you are a student while studying. This is free and very handy!

I obviously went on to do this under tutor advisement, Only to then find out we were only half way through the unit. We were not told that the exam was on the entire unit. When I went to re-book my exam as I was no where near ready, they told me I had to pay £100! 

When I enrolled onto the course, I was told there would be loads of interactive live classes. When we had these live classes, they were no where near long enough and only questions that were irrelevant were answered. I now cannot remember the last time we had a live class. It must have been at least 5 weeks, there has only been one recorded class.

Then there is the fact that there are an obscene amount  of errors in the textbooks and in the practice questions so there's no real way of knowing if you've got it right. The only way I've managed to pass so far is purely through the AAT website and finding out my own information.

Considering how much money they are happily taking from me for very little in return - I would not recommend this company for the AAT course.

All materials needed to pass the unit are presented to us in detail and there is absolutely no way to fail a unit, however tutor support sessions need to be earlier on in the unit as they're too far in and by the time we have a session, our assignment is already completed or almost completed and then needs changing if the tutor brings something up that we were not aware of. 

I also think the emphasis on helping to find you a job has been highly exaggerated. The website does not have many resources to help me find a job within HR which was one of the main reasons I picked HLC even though it was £900 more than another verified teaching school.

Tutorials are all about explaining the criteria that we are being asked to fulfil instead of adding value - just get the assignment outline consistent and correct. Really frustrating that it is so open to interpretation that we spend two hours per module with a tutor chewing threw it.
I would value tutorials and videos with practical examples more, and the opportunity to interact with the tutor in a 'classroom' environment online where I can speak rather than typing. This technology exists and is widely used?
I am really frustrated by the resources - again not consistent. The course is online based and requires harvard referencing, yet we get 'extra reading' materials without any links or proper referencing. Some weeks have no references attached but when looking up the subject matter, the notes are directly from the CIPD! 
It feels clunky, the tutor and the markers don't seem to agree on whether tables, headings and bullets are included in word count leading to very unhelpful and misleading instructions. I have submitted my latest assignment with no confidence in my word count.
It is not clear who to contact for what, and no real presence of support. I found out I was pregnant and notified my tutor after the first module. I was told I couldn't have extenuating circumstances until I pushed for a refund, when I was told, it'll be fine, and sent a form - I'd expect more from an 'HR Expert?'
A welcome pack would improve the experience of what, who and when. The navigation is difficult on the website, and there are far too many forums!!! I have no idea where to post, and don't always get a response from a tutor when it is clearly a course related question. Seems they just pick and choose. I have a colleague doing the same course with DPG, and although not directly comparable due to it being partly with face to face time in class, if I knew what I know now, I'd pay the extra £1000 to avoid what feels amateurish..

I have joined the December L5 batch. The whole experience of enquiring about the course, onboarding and getting started was just flawless.

At every step, I am getting regular updates about the course and the upcoming activities, which is great to keep you engaged.

The first session yesterday was an introductory one, where we got a hang of how exactly the course is planned and what would be our responsibilities in terms of learning/ self study and submissions.

The fact that our tutor is just a mail away is great.. Really looking forward to gain and enhance my HR knowledge with the course and resume my career with a great start.

The website is really poorly designed. It's very confusing to navigate and there are LOTS of broken links. By the way I'm not a technophobe, I'm ex Apple employee, so I get computers and websites.

They advertise the website works on multiple platforms, including iPhone and iPad. But this isn't true. You can login,but the menus don't work, so it's pointless.

The whole website is littered with typos.

During lessons, 90% of the time is taken up with providing tech support to people. From an hour ""lesson"" you might get a 1 or 2 tips on what to do for your assignment. 

They advertise free CIPD membership with your course, but it only lasts 6 months - course lasts 11 months!

The concept is good, but a lot of work is needed on the system before it's worth the money.

It is also easy to use on mobile phones and tablets which is fantastic and makes it easy to learn wherever you may be.

BUT, there have been a few problems with software for instance not recording completed modules, my first assessment was marked late and there were mistakes in the instruction given to complete work. I had to re-write my entire assessment because instructions on context were not clear and my queries were not answered. The tutoring sessions are on a set time on a Thursday evening which happens to be the one evening I am not home; therefore I have never attended an online session. I feel the qualification is quite expensive and HLC charge a very high interest rate. I applied for a student loan to fund this course but HLC were not a registered learning provider and I was declined. Finally the HLC do not give you text books despite having paid £3000 + Interest for this course, instead everything must be read on a screen apparently 'because content is always changing' rather than to save cost.",Person,,Mair,https://uk.trustpilot.com/users/57d2b6bd0000ff000a42dcfe,Thing,Avado,Organization,Trustpilot,https://uk.trustpilot.com,Rating,2

All the course materials were sent out within a couple of weeks so I am all ready to get started in a few weeks.,Person,,Hayley,https://uk.trustpilot.com/users/57c99bec0000ff000a407a1e,Thing,Avado,Organization,Trustpilot,https://uk.trustpilot.com,Rating,5

2104,Review,2016-09-02T09:18:40+00:00,Really great experience,en,"Having not studied since i was 18 and at college, I was a little worried about getting back into study mode- whether I would be able to keep up and also stay motivated throughout the course. Well, it was a fantastic experience. The online learning campus had everything i needed to support me throughout the course- live classes, recordings if i was still out when they were held, videos, activities, quizzes, areas to chat to other students- and luckily it was really easy to navigate around which was something else I worried about. It has really made a difference to my confidence at work.
I have some colleagues signing up now as well after i recommended AVADO. Hope to return to take the next level.",Person,,Susie,https://uk.trustpilot.com/users/57c943ef0000ff000a405c83,Thing,Avado,Organization,Trustpilot,https://uk.trustpilot.com,Rating,5
2105,Review,2016-09-01T08:38:15+00:00,AVADO Digital - Executive Diploma in Digital Business,en,"I completed AVADO Digital’s Executive Diploma in Digital Business in July this year – I couldn’t recommend it enough!

Over the 6 month course I built up a tonne of confidence, both in terms of knowledge – knowing what’s going on in the digital space, where to find it, who/what to follow – and in practical skills – SEO, project management techniques and using social media, to name a few.

Having never done a completely online course before I was apprehensive (as it later transpired as were most of my fellow students!), but the course was structured in such a way to really help build a supportive community. In addition, the AVADO Digital Community Support team (in particular, thanks to Beth!) were always at hand - and occasionally welcomingly sympathetic! - when deadlines loomed and I needed a bit of hand holding.

This course was hard work at times, but gave me an awesome grounding in the principles and practices of Digital that I will use to move me through my career. Bravo!",Person,,Emma,https://uk.trustpilot.com/users/5582817a0000ff0001c6c820,Thing,Avado,Organization,Trustpilot,https://uk.trustpilot.com,Rating,5
