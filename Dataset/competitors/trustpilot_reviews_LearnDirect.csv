They give you these course materials for you to read and expect you to understand right away. There are no online tutor classes like some other online learning platforms. When you do not understand your assignment and write an email to your tutor they take days to a week to even give you a reply and when they do reply they not explain in detail. I am a visual learning I learn by watching and just reading. It won't let me pass this course. I NEED MORE SUPPORT! And please upgrade the platform and introduce some online tutor learning classes.

I am not hearing to speak bad about Learndirect however, Just to mention my terrible experience while studying with them. Worse of All, if you cancel the course after the 14day enrolment, you will be charged the same amount per month which I think is ABSURD & INSANE!
I have been charged  almost ¬£700 which I DEMAND REFUND! I changed the course and I still get charged for the ORIGINAL AMOUNT! I have a debt of ¬£460 to PAY NOW!

The units take sometimes up to a week to be marked, then you get them back with little to no help and when you ask questions it takes 3-4 days to recieve feedback so you can make changes. By this time, you've missed your deadline which all reflects on your qualification for university. I wouldn't recommend studying with learn direct due to the lack of support given from the tutors, who just seem to respond with ""read unit 3 - academic writing."" Considering I pay ¬£175 a month, you'd think you would have a tutor who would be reliable and give detailed advice. After speaking to customer services, I was essentially told to get on with it. 
Definitely look elsewhere to study this course as you don't get the extra push to help you succeed with learn direct, just your confidence kicked down and threats of losing your place on the course you pay for.",Person,,katie Hughes,https://uk.trustpilot.com/users/5f76297a3db1d21475bb3aba,Thing,learndirect Limited,Organization,Trustpilot,https://uk.trustpilot.com,Rating,2

However, changed my mind within 14 days and having not accessed any course material let alone been assigned a tutor or submitted any work. Since this I am being hounded with threats saying they can track my usage of the materials and that will be enough to take me to court ! Sincerely regret having anything to do with this company. Would not recommend to anyone !

Can't identify me from my name - you email me constantly threatening me and the email address contains my name !! Tried to say my review was unverified because they don't like what I'm saying. Showed trust pilot the proof of my awful experience with learn direct and they have verified this review now. Awful, underhand company. I would actually be questioning the authenticity of the positive reviews

Further update 

Still being hounded and apparently even though I cancelled, the tutors and markers have all been paid. Therefore, I have to pay them, even though I completed no course work and wasn't allocated a tutor. In summary I have to pay for a course that I cancelled and had no access to and absolutely no work was completed on. I sincerely regret having anything to do with this unethical company. I'm sure they're fine as long as they are getting their money but God forbid you cancel !!!",Person,https://user-images.trustpilot.com/5a468b720000ff000af81422/73x73.png,Amy Lowry,https://uk.trustpilot.com/users/5a468b720000ff000af81422,Thing,learndirect Limited,Organization,Trustpilot,https://uk.trustpilot.com,Rating,1

The staff all say different things, there is no clue amongst them on how the refund process works and despite saying they will be in contact with me ASAP, they are not and the communication with each other is worse than with their customers.

They do not care about your learning, they never respond to your messages and the people on thier phone lines are rude and sarcastic. After having trouble with them for weeks, I found out they had added on 400 pound to my account for an exam, yes one exam. I tried to stop payment for this and because of that they've blocked access to BOTH my courses even though the other is PAID UP TO DATE. They don't respond to queries you have or help you in anyway but they quickly add on money where they want and block your account. Also tutor response is so slow and materials are useless. I am on many nursing pages on social media and so many people have the same issues. DO NOT use this company, go elsewhere there's many other places who do the same courses for cheaper and treat you much better.",Person,,Carly,https://uk.trustpilot.com/users/60396d1767c0cf001af57faa,Thing,learndirect Limited,Organization,Trustpilot,https://uk.trustpilot.com,Rating,1

My recent experience has been terrible with them. Although it was all good when I first contacted them, one of their team member, Harry Forrestal, explained to me the whole process in detail but when I realised that it was going to cost too much, I told him I didn't want to go ahead. But he convinced me to book the course for now as he claimed they had one last space for a deal to get it cheaper which I now think is complete rubbish and that I could delete it anytime and I would be refunded with my deposit.

What he failed to mention was that it would take them a month to refund it. Believing him I did book it but then cancelled it the next day and I was assured I would get my deposit back.

Its now a month and 11 days and I still haven't recieved it. I've rung them about 4-5 times and each time they'll say I w,ill be deffinitely getting it and that it has been processed but I still dont see it in my account. I dont understand as to why it takes them so long just to return ¬£29.99.

277,Review,2021-04-20T12:38:39+00:00,"Course confusion initially, resolved quickly and effectively.",en,"EDIT - someone from customer services quickly contacted me and have now apologised for the confusion. This was all sorted within an hour. They have now made clear how the course works and have assured me this mix up won‚Äôt happen again. James was extremely helpful and has assured me that I will be able to complete the course fully and that time constraints are not an issue. I am happy to continue with the course and am confident this will not happen again to future people, I guess everyone has to learn from mistakes. I would recommend you give the course a go and if you have issues contact James and his team. 

I have kept it at 4 starts due to the initial mix up but like I said, hopefully all good from now on. 

I signed up for the teaching assistant diploma course and was assured covid wouldn‚Äôt affect things. I was told I can do ALL the theory side of things and do the practical placement in a school at the end of the course. Turns out this was a complete lie. I‚Äôve got to assignment 4 and cannot continue with the course without a placement. I spoke to my tutor about this and when she realised I wasn‚Äôt being stupid and was genuinely  confused due to conflicting information she was helpful in explaining how the course actually works. I‚Äôve tried to get a placement now schools are open again but government guidelines dictate they still cannot accept me and don‚Äôt know when they will be able to. I called customer services who advised me to continue with the theory side of the course (again) so I had to explain to them how the course actually works. They said they would pass this onto someone higher up, but just passed it onto my tutor which wasn‚Äôt helpful as she‚Äôs done what she can to help. I‚Äôve now just been told to read through the information on the course by my tutor which is a pointless exercise as I can‚Äôt use the information I‚Äôve read and will just have to read through it all again when I can actually progress with the course. I‚Äôve spent hundreds of pounds on a course that I can‚Äôt complete and feel like I was mislead simply to get me to sign up and hand money over. Customer services are less than helpful and clearly don‚Äôt know what they‚Äôre talking about. My tutor has been helpful but there‚Äôs only so much she can do as she‚Äôs only really there to mark my assignments. I‚Äôve been told not to worry about the time limit but I bet they‚Äôll be quick to ask for more money when I reach it. Don‚Äôt trust anything they say, they don‚Äôt know what they‚Äôre talking about. Extremely frustrated and upset that I‚Äôve parted with so much money for potentially nothing. 

If you‚Äôre thinking about signing up, at least wait until the pandemic ends because it may affect your course, even though they‚Äôll tell you it won‚Äôt. 

The second star is only because my tutor has actually tried to offer advice.",Person,,Miss Smith,https://uk.trustpilot.com/users/5d0a5cf8923d9c641befa888,Thing,learndirect Limited,Organization,Trustpilot,https://uk.trustpilot.com,Rating,4

386,Review,2021-03-29T22:22:49+00:00,Study with another company.,en,"There are so many inconsistencies with what is asked of you with LearnDirect. I am currently currently studying an Access to HE Diploma in Midwifery and it has definitely not been enjoyable. 
1. There are 21 units to complete, each marked by a different tutor each time so they have no idea who you are or your capabilities. Some tutors give decent feedback and recommendations whilst others not so much... i submitted a formal complaint about how one spoke to me via email as it was appalling. 
2. I am on unit 13 and only now am I being told not to use a certain website to extract information from as they are 'an unreliable source', yet i have used it before and never had this mentioned.
3. I have been asked on several occasions to provide an essay for no more than 2,000 words, yet there will be 5 or 6 questions that need to be answered in 'detail'. To fit the word count is impossible with what they ask. 
4. I question if the tutors really read submissions fully at times, as I have been advised to discuss certain topics even though I have done that...
5. In feedback I have been penalised for not reading and taking information from NHS websites, even though it was never stated that it was a requirement for me to fulfil the question and obtain a Distinction Grade....I am not a mind reader. 

Overall I would not recommend Learn Direct as a means to somebody undertaking an Access Course.

I informed them I was querying the accreditation and would want to cancel if not properly accredited. 

They never got back to me and so yesterday I finally got tired of waiting and called up, only to be told there is absolutely no trace of the message I sent them. They are now refusing to cancel as it's outside of their 14 day policy despite me initially contacting them within the same week. I find it oddly convenient for them that my message vanished.

He was very speedy in his approach in relation to payment and also gave me a discount for enrolling today! I really appreciated that!

I spoke with him again on the chat link via the Learn Direct site and he answered my question. He also told me how to contact my tutor and gave me a telephone number to call.

Another thing I would like to add is that this is my first time studying with Learn Direct and happy that they followed what they said online with regards to the payment plan. From my previous experience with another company was a different story and totally opposite with what they stated online. 

I very much appreciate this kind of service!

This course is very affordable and cheap! I like that I can pay as little as ¬£32 a month and study at my own pace.

865,Review,2021-01-30T21:51:28+00:00,So far.....so disappointed,en,"Update number 2.....the integrity of my review has been questioned. No doubt due to the fact that I haven't changed it to 5 stars! Learn direct don't feel that it is genuine so I have had to prove my enrolment in order to keep this review live. In other words...they don't want any lower reviews against their business name üôà

Just to clarify. My initial review was 1 star, I upgraded to 3 stars after a fantastic response from James. James's response warrants 5 stars but my initial experience was 1 star hence my mid rating now. As my experience with the company continues I may upgrade it further but I won't be pushed into a high review at this point!

I'm not willing to change to a higher rating at this point as I only enrolled on 21st Jan and my experience is both good and bad at the minute. James's help was fantastic but he is one individual who's job is to improve reviews I think! 

Update! 

So after posting my review late Saturday evening, I received a phone call at 9am on Sunday morning! It was instantly sorted and I was switched to the correct course by a very helpful person called James. Amazing service! 

Now in my eyes this doesn't excuse the appalling service from the previous week but credit where it's due to James. He was polite, helpful and got the job done without delay.

One thing to note Learndirect....it shouldn't take a bad review to get customer support sorted out! That said, I'm grateful to now be able to continue with my course. 

So far.....so disappointed. 

I enrolled over the phone on 21/01/21. I was offered a brilliant discount and after clarifying that this was the course I wanted, I signed up. I got immediate access to the content and was very impressed with how easy it was to get online and start studying. 

I realised 2 days later that I had been enrolled on the wrong course so I phoned straight away and spoke to someone who couldn't help and advised me to call back after 10am the next day (Sunday) so I did. I then spoke to a lady who seemed very helpful, she said her manager would need to listen to the call recording so I could expect a call back the next day....it wasn't forthcoming.

I had wanted the Access to HE Medicine and Healthcare Professionals but was enrolled on Access to HE Health Professionals instead. 

So since then I have made 4 more calls. I am still on the wrong course and still have had no call back from a manager. 

Perhaps complaining on a public forum will get me somewhere?",Person,,Claire,https://uk.trustpilot.com/users/6015d4c662e0f8001a488a5d,Thing,learndirect Limited,Organization,Trustpilot,https://uk.trustpilot.com,Rating,3

I‚Äôve been trying to organise the practical session of my course and was told that they don‚Äôt have enough tutors and are trying to recruit so the next available training date is 12 months after I signed up for the course. My original course date should have been moved, but nobody contacted me. After numerous emails someone called me and my name wasn‚Äôt even in the list. I‚Äôm still paying the monthly payment with absolutely no idea when I will actually be able to start recouping my costs. I would like to clarify that Stonebridge were lovely and reassuring but lease do not book this course through Learn Direct. One you have enrolled they are rude, dismissive and only interested in getting paid without offering any level of service.
Having read the review please be aware that this is nothing to do with covid. I‚Äôm more than understanding of the current situation but please don‚Äôt use it as an excuse for leaving me off the list to rearrange the date and not having any dates because of lack of tutors which I was told by the college. You then completely lied in your response saying that you had enough tutors. So who‚Äôs lying????? I just wanted a date and if I‚Äôd had a date then it was cancelled because of covid I would be fine.

It is important to me (for logistic reasons) that I finish in July and I am happy to put in the time needed to do this and much more. However it does not matter how much time I put into the course if I have to be psychic to know what is going to pass! The website and the telephone sales person say that: ‚Äúdedicated‚Äù,‚Äúyour very own personal tutor‚Äú, ‚ÄúYou can contact them via email or phone‚Äù (learndirect.com, how-it-works page, 30/12/2020). This is not true; dedicated = you have a person who has a day job and will look at your work late at night, possibly exhausted, for pocket money. Your very own personal tutor = a different tutor for every assessment, no continuity. You can contact them by phone = oh no you can not! and if you try to then the customer service staff are rude and unhelpful. Your contact with the tutors will be via the messaging service, which is a bad version of email and does not always work, there were weeks when I could not access any messages at all. If you can see your messages you will find that the ‚Äòtutors‚Äô have 3 days in which to reply to you, and some of them make you wait the full three days! This makes ‚Äútalking‚Äù to your tutor a painful and unproductive experience (and yes they use the word ‚Äútalk‚Äù in the website and when they are tele-selling to you, even though you are never allowed to actually talk to them, only write). The cryptic feedback has left me shaking my head in complete bemusement about what on earth they are looking for in an assessment. The crushing word limits on the assignments leave you unable to cover a subject fully and show that you know your stuff, and leave you having to guess what the specific handful of words they are looking for are! I dispute the term ‚Äòtutor‚Äô as this implies ‚Äúa private teacher, typically one who teaches a single pupil or a very small group‚Äù (Google dictionary 30/12/2020) as you get no such person; What  you get is an assessor who gives you cryptic messages, they do not teach you anything at all. Lastly, the peer support is almost entirely composed of people asking to join external whatsapp groups, there is almost no peer support within the course.",Person,,Meesar,https://uk.trustpilot.com/users/5fec87082f98d1001a921768,Thing,learndirect Limited,Organization,Trustpilot,https://uk.trustpilot.com,Rating,1

They are in breach of their own T&Cs. Technically stealing money and not providing a service.

Their T&C state:
In accordance with The Consumer Contracts (Information, Cancellation and Additional Charges) Regulations 2013, which replaced the Consumer Protection (Distance Selling) Regulations 2000, you may cancel your course anytime within fourteen days after you receive your course materials whether in hard copy or online.

I decided to contact customer services within the given 14 working days to cancel my contract, but was told I‚Äôm unable to even though on the day of contact it was 10 working days. Since then I have contacted the customer service team several times by letter, email and phone to try and rectify this, sometimes not even getting a response. I‚Äôm now paying ¬£1,754 for the full course even though I was within my rights to cancel. I don‚Äôt mind paying for the bit I accessed before I tried to cancel but when I contact customer services they‚Äôve said all I can do is do another course of the same value or higher. Customer service were very rude and unprofessional on the phone, I have been shouted at saying I can‚Äôt have a refund. I wouldn‚Äôt recommend this company.

EDIT UPDATE: I was contacted by James within the hour of putting my review up. He got back in touch today and should be cancelling my contract and refunding part of my payments within a few days.
Will update when payment is done!

I tried to make a complaint but its been more than 10 days and I've had no answer at all.

I believe this is done so you cannot ask for a refund as you have started the course. NO WAY was my course worth ¬£370+. They recommended a book (which probably has more information in it than the course material did) that you can only buy on amazon and costs ¬£30+. My course also came with a kit but they couldn't tell me when I would get it, only that I would. 
I feel completely ripped off now. I wish I'd gone elsewhere.

1376,Review,2020-11-06T11:24:53+00:00,"Enrolment was fantastic, tutor support less so.",en,"Enrolment was fantastic. Laura answered my questions efficiently and credibly. However I have been studying for 3 weeks and it isn't quite the experience it was sold on. I have studied 4 units and I am on my 5th, however only 1 has been marked and you can't submit any work until the previous is achieved. This isn't a huge issue however I need to work through this course in a relatively short time due to intending to start Uni in September. I haven't had a call from my tutor which in a learning role I would expect to have an initial introduction call to understand my goals and aspirations in order for the tutor to help me achieve them. I find it ironic that one of my Units is all about learning theories where i have to understand my own, yet the tutors have no intention of helping us work to this. This isn't a negative against the tutors as it is the system and SLAs that have been set up.I don't expect hand holding as it is an online course but I would expect an initial relationship building call to cover initial questions and learn how each other prefer to work which is critical in learning and business. I also require a certain number of D/M/P to get on my call so I would have liked to have discussed with my tutor and had her give suggestions on best practise in order to obtain as many distinctions as possible.

The online support team are fantastic, a lady called Emma has helped very efficiently however I was told the tutors often come back the same day but this certainly isn't the case. I am currently working on an assignment planner where we have to stipulate timescales for each step and the one thing holding me off hitting each step is the time it takes to get a reply on a simple clarification. I find this frustrating as I have planned sufficient time to study yet can't always move past a specific question. I chose learndirect even though it was a bit more expensive as I expected a higher level of service. 
Another gripe is the learning materials are obviously online but I prefer to have somethings on paper and the materials aren't print friendly so you have to copy and paste as printing directly doesn't format them. It's a shame you can't purchase a booklet for those of us who like to make notes on our handouts.
if your self motivated and able to study alone, the quality of the learning materials are great but if you struggle to motivate yourself, this might not be the course for you. 
The messaging system isn't very effective, it would be great to have a level 1 support team via IM who could provide the answers to more simply questions, referring the more detailed subject questions to tutors.",Person,,Nicola ,https://uk.trustpilot.com/users/5cfa329899e218356ed18131,Thing,learndirect Limited,Organization,Trustpilot,https://uk.trustpilot.com,Rating,3

They offered me a break of payments so I could still do it and then pay later, or a reduction of course costs, which I appreciated so very much, and I am so glad that I have met understanding and help. 
Unfortunately I couldn't take the offers, as financially we are just very anxious for the moment, as the future is very uncertain. 
But I will definitel come back again, and would recommend it to everyone.

1398,Review,2020-11-02T14:31:32+00:00,Course just okay; fairly bad experience with customer service,en,"Overall, I found elements of the course interesting and useful (the materials for the course do need updating, however, and I found myself having to read significantly around the subject area to make my answers to certain questions relevant). 

My experience with customer service was moderate. Some representatives were proactive, others not so.

I received my certificate (and cashback) a fair few months after completing the course, but you do have to pester customer services for this. They won't update you otherwise.

I was asked back around the time of completing the course whether I would be happy to take part in a 'case study', which required me to write answers to a number of questions. I was promised a payment for this; however, it was never paid and subsequent e-mails regarding payment were ignored. Beware of completing such case studies.

Update: despite a 'rapid' response to this review from Learndirect, and the matter taken up and apparently resolved by issuing a cheque, I never received it (nor was there any follow up e-mail stating it had been issued). This has been a long-running theme with Learndirect, where documents or cheques are apparently issued, or popped in the post, but never received. 

I'm not sure what is going on with Learndirect, but it's certainly been a pretty disappointing experience all round.",Person,,Tom,https://uk.trustpilot.com/users/5fa01828f39a01001abff56d,Thing,learndirect Limited,Organization,Trustpilot,https://uk.trustpilot.com,Rating,1

A few years ago I took a level 3 personal training course with another provider and I stopped at level 2 due to the hidden costs involved and amount of travelling that was required to the testing venues. So when I enrolled with learndirect it was great to sign up and there were no extra costs involved and the ability to study from home. I assign a full day a week to go through each module and then I complete the assignment at the end for each module. The quality and information provided in the modules were much better than the personal training course I was on with another provider before.

This would be easier than sourcing everything myself. When booking the course I was told it would be sent shortly after I made full payment for the course, or after I had made half the instalments if I spread it out. I opted to pay in full and get the kit quicker. I have now been told, after chasing several times and completing all my theory work, that the kits aren‚Äôt in stock and they don‚Äôt know when they‚Äôll be available. I would have been better off using a different provider and sourcing my own kit. I feel I was misled at booking, and when I first chased the kit as I wasn‚Äôt told the truth. I have gone to a different provider for the subsequent courses I have wanted to do. The theory materials were good, and exams marked quickly with clear feedback.

Edit: the message responding to me from Learn Direct claiming kit was dispatched following this review should be ignored. Nothing has been dispatched to me. I have removed a star from my original review. I have contacted their customer service team again and have been told there is no one there who can assist me so I have to call back Monday.

1492,Review,2020-10-17T07:18:03+00:00,Terrible customer service.,en,"I purchased a course with Learndirect. When i purchased there was no explanation that the exams weren't included- just a polite reference would've helped me consider. 
So after months of study i ask if i can complete the exams. It took weeks for someone to come back to me to tell me there's a large additional cost. 
The person i spoke to also said i should be entitled to a discount as i'd already paid for the courses. 
I contacted and proceeded to contact this company on more than 10 occasions to request booking and arranging my exams. 
After waiting again on the phone for over 20 minutes to get through a few days ago, i was reassured that i'd get a call back.... nothing! 
I am frustrated and irritated by the lack of communication. 
I would do you research more and not go with this company... turns out the course i paid hundreds for is actually available FREE via other companies.",Person,,Lorraine Morgan,https://uk.trustpilot.com/users/5f18502e59f37f1b9e79fe79,Thing,learndirect Limited,Organization,Trustpilot,https://uk.trustpilot.com,Rating,1

Would obviously not recommend.


21-November-2020
After having to proof my relationship with learn direct(learndirect  reported your review because they don't believe you've had a genuine buying or service experience. Reported reviews are temporarily moved offline.)they agreed to pay me a refund. Here is a copy of the email:

I can confirm that we have received your request to cancel your course, and thus your course cancellation has been approved. We are terribly sorry to hear that you have decided not to study with us and hope that you will consider doing so in the future.

Once again, we are sorry to hear that you no longer wish to study with us, and you will receive the appropriate refund your fees within the next 30 days.

Kind regards,

Alison Jones

Head of Cancellations and conversions.

Well,again they have failed to do what they promised.

From my experience I just can advise you to think twice before buying any service,and if you do,please make sure you check everything asap.If you wish to cancel and you call them someone will say that they will do it for you, which didn't happened in my case,and your cancellation period will expire.Make sure you email them as well!!! Writing a review helps a lot! That's the only way they contact you straight away!!",Person,,Patricia,https://uk.trustpilot.com/users/5f7f7f64da5df400194495d1,Thing,learndirect Limited,Organization,Trustpilot,https://uk.trustpilot.com,Rating,1

I am also still waiting for my certification after finishing my course july 10th, now its the end of september and due to this lack of certification i havent been able to apply for jobs which has been infuriating, but if you dont need your certificate then this is better than most online learning. you also have the added advantage of know that you are doing a bonified course and not one of those cheap courses that are no good to anyone. i finished my supported learning cache within about 9 months of daily studying.",Person,https://user-images.trustpilot.com/56a672a90000ff0001ffbc84/73x73.png,victoria Askey,https://uk.trustpilot.com/users/56a672a90000ff0001ffbc84,Thing,learndirect Limited,Organization,Trustpilot,https://uk.trustpilot.com,Rating,4

I feel very disappointed. I did my course to better my options professionally.  Seems I wasted my time. And money.

Learn direct asked me for my contact details following this post so they could contact me regarding my certification. 
I forwarded my contact details for this to happen.  And guess what.  Still NO response whatsoever ever.  
What a complete waste of a year of studies and money.

""Our cancellation procedure is detailed within our Terms and Conditions and we are very strict on this being followed accordingly.""

""To cancel your course you must contact the customer service team 01202 006346 within office hours Monday -Friday 9am-5pm. Please note cancellations cannot be accepted via email or postal format.""

As instructed by their T&Cs I called them on Friday 11 September (same day I signed up for the course) to cancel my course purchase, but they refused to do so. Their representative said I would receive a link to a form   for me to fill in on Monday.

On Saturday I received a call from someone at Learndirect asking me how I was getting on with the course. I explained that I had requested a cancellation the day before, but the representative told me she was not aware of a cancellation request from me.

I then called Learndirect again on Monday and they finally emailed me the link to the cancellation form WHICH IS NOT PART OF their cancellation procedure stated in their T&Cs. Their representative on the phone threatened to ignore my cancellation request if I didn't fill in the form and submitted it back to them for review even though I argued that I didn't have to do that as it is not stated in their T&Cs.

I'd also like to point out that when I first signed up for the course on the phone, I asked their sales  representative if they could provide me with a course sample for me to try before buying, but he said that I would have 14 days to try the course after paying for it, and that all I had to do to cancel was to call their cancellation team. He didn't tell me that I would have to call them twice, wait for a link to a form, fill in the form, submit it back to them, and wait for them to review and approve my request.

It has been more than 7 days since I first called to request cancellation and refund, but I still have not received my refund.",Person,,Mr Da Silva,https://uk.trustpilot.com/users/5910890a0000ff000a95bede,Thing,learndirect Limited,Organization,Trustpilot,https://uk.trustpilot.com,Rating,1

Called customer care within the 14 days cooling off period to cancel my course but no chance to get through. So I did through email. Then, called again to confirm cancellation and very rudely they said not to and I could only possibly change the course or pay it in full!! Customer care is awful and disgraceful. I have been monthly paying a lot money for nothing until now. Do not waste your time and money. Should have gone for a different provider. These people are restricting people rights on purpose to get their money. Paid nearly ¬£260 for nothing. They don't care about customers or students they are only after your money!!

Along with multiple errors like typos and grammar. When I started to do mock exams I realised that the online learning was not representative of what was expected in the exam. Eg. the exam questions were far more complex than what I was used to studying with the online content. I also noted that certain subjects were not covered online but we‚Äôre asked in the exam. I found the staff I dealt with helpful and competent  but they were so understaffed that I was unable to get the tuition I needed before the exam. As with many people I‚Äôve struggled with maths all my life and failed all maths exams at school often getting ungraded marks. For that reason I invested endless hours of study and gained 70% pass in my mock exam. Unfortunately however I failed my real exam. It would be easy for me to loose confidence and believe I didn‚Äôt try hard enough, or I‚Äôm not clever enough to pass. Had I been given material that accurately reflected the final exam to learn from I think I would have passed easily.

I initially signed up and was excited however unfortunately my financial situation changed and I needed to cancel and withdraw. However I was then informed that I could withdraw however they are still charging me each month. 

I have written 3 emails to complain and sort this out however they do not reply. When I try to ring they do not answer!! 

Also for the cost of the course to only be able to have 1 session with your tutor per subject for the whole course is also very disappointing

I cancelled within the 14 day period and I'm now being threatened with high court enforcement and BAILIFFS!

I've emailed MANY times with my concerns etc and I'm either ignored, or not taken seriously. I have a LONG string of emails back and forth bickering with absolutely NO help or understanding apart from 'you have to pay'. I have serious concerns about the course I signed up to, and the SUB STANDARD teaching, but I haven't been taken seriously at all.

I received independant advice that I was within my rights with everything I have done but when I quoted MY LEGAL RIGHTS as a consumer, which protect me, I was told by Learn Direct 'those are a sweeping statement."" -Yeah, course, the LAW that's put in place to protect me from vultures like YOU!

I've never been so disgusted at the customer service and treatment of a customer in all my life. They can't even follow their own complaints procedure either. I asked again and again over 2 months ago to make a complaint and my complaint was never even submitted.

Sure, it's easy to sign up. But be VERY, VERY careful. I would advise to go elsewhere where you can get better for A LOT cheaper. I have serious concerns about Learn Direct, and I plan to take this further. We'll see how far your bailiffs get.

I am still waiting a response from them. I have received my nail kit after months and months however, i am still waiting my ¬£100 cash back which i was informed would take 30 days we are now nearly 3 months later. I am currently speaking with my bank to see if i can recall my money due to the false advertisement of learn direct. I am also speaking with trading standards and OFSTED. DO NOT BUY ANY COURSES FROM THIS COMPANY!!!!!!



If i could give 0 stars i would. Signed up for level 3 nail tech course, ¬£19.99 to start with and ¬£48.70 for 10 months. The course highlights once you get a free nail kit with the course after paying at least 50% for the course which is fine by me. Course also says once paid for you get ¬£100 cash back. So i was half way through paying February time and waited on my nail kit. We then entered lock down and everything went all up in the air so i forgot about the nail kit. Come June i start asking about my nail kit to be told its on its way don't worry its being packed you will get an email to say it will come. Two weeks later no nail kit, to be told yes we don't have it still waiting, but you told me 2 weeks ago it was there and on way. To be told yes well this was not true. I have then spent the last 3 months trying to get a nail kit that i have paid for that they do not seem to want to give me, i have paid for the course now and guess what yup i am now fighting to get my ¬£100 cash back from learndirect wonder if this will be blamed on the pandemic as well? Learndirect are now refusing to answer my emails when i have rang to ask what is happening i have just spoken to the most rude and condescending person ever who informed me they had a meeting this morning and still not nail kit but does not know anything as its not her job. So how did she know about the nail kit? I am sick to death of being fobbed off. I would NEVER use them again and will be telling everyone i know to NEVER use them either.

Out dated expensive rip off. I paid for a course in SEN, which I doubt it‚Äôs credibility for one. The course appears to be out dated and the questions for the wording seem to be very basic comprehension style. Never any difference in feed back from the tutor. Just the same sentence re written each time. Which offered me no chance of development or insight into what I learnt. Finished the course in one month due to its simplicity. I contacted them for my 100pound cash back to be told it would be sent as a cheque. Who deals in cheques anymore?!?

Totally disgusting for a company to sell outdated courses that aren't worth the money. Research accredited before being sucked in as it's not valid most places. No wonder ofsted rated them inadequate in 2017 and the government removed all their contracts. 

Initially signed up and everything seemed great. Questions answered, sales great, however, the course content was not as expected. Luckily I cancelled in the 14 days but just in case don't submit anything if you are unsure as others have been refused refund for this reason. Course content looked like it had not been changed since it was written 15 years ago and even stated awaiting update 2007 on specific guidelines. Very unprofessional for the price course and also on response from learndirect that most learners are not bothered by it and will usually continue the course. Sadly it put me off enough to cancel. So the cancellation process within 14 days. Call to cancel after 7, informed I had to complete an online form, which I did, then informed it would take up to 7 days to receive a telephone interview call for the cancellation to proceed, after the telephone call I was informed my cancellation would go ahead. After a week I called as no sign of refund. Was told it takes 30 days to process. A week after this I received an email confirming my cancellation, yes just over 2 weeks after my cancellation request telephone conversation, where I had been told I had cancelled and would get refunded. 

Added to that the incentive after the first few days receiving the course access to write a positive trust pilot review and be in with a chance of winning a free course. Sorry to say, I've since done my own research. The courses may say accredited but they don't mean a lot and are not worth the money. Look at the invited reviews, they are the ones where people starting are bribed to write reviews with the chance to win free courses.

1880,Review,2020-08-20T21:13:34+00:00,It was stressful!,en,"In September last year, I signed to a course and the man I spoke to seemed lovely and seemed to know what he was talking about. I read the reviews and people were struggling to get answers about certain things and even struggling to get the certificates from them. The guy explained this away as they probably hadn‚Äôt paid their fees yet and that was the reason for their delay. I signed up after having a few concerns cleared up. 
Forward it on to the completion of my course in March this year. Buzzing that I had finished and I‚Äôd got my email to say it had been graded. With excitement I checked to see where you normally get a pass or fail and it just received. I emailed learn direct to be told that I should get an email to say I‚Äôve passed. This didn‚Äôt happen. I was told various different this over months of trying to find out what was happening. I was then told it would take 12-14 weeks to find out if I‚Äôd passed. At 18 weeks I still hadn‚Äôt heard anything. It was so frustrating and annoying not knowing. Learn direct didn‚Äôt really have a clue and I kept getting different information every time I spoke to them, they aren‚Äôt really interested unless signing up to do a course or you‚Äôre settling up you balance. Even when I had paid up there was no further information given about my course or the status. I received my certificate (5 months after paying it off) in the post today which is great and I suppose you can say they did their job to a certain extent. Just be mindful that if you do a course through this company, don‚Äôt expect them to know what‚Äôs happening with your course. I know they‚Äôll blame Covid but they literally had no clue about how the course worked or was marked regardless. 
That being said the course was good but slightly outdated but I definitely learnt a lot from it and it encouraged me to look in to policies for myself. I would do more now I know what to expect.",Person,,Kerry ,https://uk.trustpilot.com/users/5b80453f4de5666d34da9972,Thing,learndirect Limited,Organization,Trustpilot,https://uk.trustpilot.com,Rating,3

1898,Review,2020-08-17T16:26:54+00:00,New Beginnings,en,"I am so excited to start my new chapter in life. I had ventured back and forth over Learn Direct and attending a college course. Due to my current employer, I could not attend set days at college, therefore online learning is the way forward for me. I researched and compared the courses to find the Access to Higher Education course through Learn Direct is exactly the same that I would have earned attending college. I now have the bonus of immediate access to my online course without having to leave the house.... I'm staying firmly put when its raining or snowing outside. This alone makes me extremely happy! I questioned online Learn Direct advisors for weeks, they all responded quickly and had a answer for every question I threw at them. I researched the future university I wish to attend and they confirmed they definitely accept Learn Direct qualifications so that put my mind at ease. I then spoke to a Learn Direct advisor, the advice given is so clear I was left with no doubts. I knew exactly who I was speaking to, who will call me later in the week just to check on me and who I can contact throughout my course. They have a big support network so you can't and won't be stuck on your own at any point. I had concerns I wouldn't be able to achieve enough UCAS points, I was advised by James I would need a merit to score enough UCAS points but I shouldn't be disheartened as I could easily aim for Distinction if i put my mind to it. I can complete the course in my own time, up to 2 years. I aim to smash this course with flying colours within 1 year or less. Even more satisfied James told me they help with University applications and they have a immense network of school, college and university connections. I'm so happy I can pay for this course over 10 months, I couldn't afford full payment in one go (tough when saving for a wedding!) As promised, I would get three confirmation emails. I set up my login and BAM.... there's my course ready to start immediately. I have taken on this new direction due to Covid, I currently work in the travel industry and Im really not sure how that will pan out but I feel confident I'm moving in the right direction into Nursing. I really couldn't have made this change without the online learning from Learn Direct. Im currently 35, my advice to anyone ..... It really is never too late to change direction. Today is my first day as a online student, I finally understand the direction I want to go in. I will achieve my dream to be a registered nurse thanks to taking my first steps with Learn Direct.",Person,,Lindsay,https://uk.trustpilot.com/users/5d9b819bf37572705a57957c,Thing,learndirect Limited,Organization,Trustpilot,https://uk.trustpilot.com,Rating,5

No chance....,en,"The content of the course was great and when I was signing up to the course the customer service was great too (but obviously they were getting my money so they would be). However, due to the current pandemic, I have suffered a couple of bereavements and loss of income so I'm not able to cover the costs anymore. I haven't completed any modules and have only just started reading the first module. I called up the customer service team and the operative on the end of the phone was extremely unhelpful and un-empathetic. The tone of her voice was unpleasant and told me that because it was out of the 14 day cooling off period there was nothing they could do. I then drew her attention to where the agreement states outside of the 14 day period, cancellations may be considered on a case by case basis with a 50% cancellation fee if accepted. I was happy to go down this route but then she said the manager wasn't back in until Tuesday next week and an answer wouldn't be sought until then at least. I was still happy to do this. She then said it's very unlikely they will accept this. This, in my opinion, is evidence they will not consider me on a case to case basis. It's really not difficult to show a little bit of compassion even if there really is nothing you can do.

1908,Review,2020-08-14T09:42:45+00:00,Misleading T&Cs & breach of contract,en,"UPADTE: What a surprise! Got a reply to my review saying to contact their customer service team. My case is clearly already being handled so why would I get in touch again to further miscommunicate on their end? Goes to show their complete lack of regard for each individual case.

Another point to add, before you read all of the five star reviews (like I did,) please read the negative reviews. Learndirect encourage people to review right at the start of the course as an incentive to win prizes, that's why there are so many good ones.

--------------------------------------------------------------

Upon signing up to the Access to HE (Social Sciences course) I was reassured by their company representative Harry that I would be eligible for a refund if I didn't get along with the course within 14 days of starting it. I asked him explicitly about their cancellation policy both through the chat function on the website, and on the phone when he called to take payment. This is also stated in their T&Cs.

I began the course, tried out the process of submitting the first unit to see if it would work for me considering I would be doing it for the next year if so. 9 days in, I decided that the course wasn't for me and called their customer service team, as instructed in their cancellation policy, to request a refund and cancel the course.

To put it into perspective, their T&Cs state their cancellation policy as: ""In line with The Consumer Rights Act 2015, you also have a 14 day right to change your mind and get a full refund for digital content, i.e. Online courses, that you have purchased, unless you have already started to download it""

I thought: ""Well, great! I haven't downloaded anything because it's all through an online portal, I will be eligible for the refund. They haven't stated any reason for me to think otherwise!"" If only it could have been that straightforward. 

Let's jump to over a month later, during which: my refund has been refused, I have endured two weeks of horrendous communication with Learndirect/Stonebridge via telephone, email and letters, have called citizens advice for help, am two weeks into disputing the payment with my bank to try and get the money back that way, and am getting ready to take the next steps of going to the ombudsman. The two people who are handling my case are David and Alison. (I wont state surnames as per Trustpilot guidelines.)

Their reason for refusing my refund request? ""... Because you have accessed the material, begun the course, and submitted your first piece of work to a tutor, which has been marked."" I would be enlightened for someone to tell me where that advice is given in their T&Cs. Is 'unless you download it' supposed to translate into the very detailed reasoning above?

Their misleading cancellation policy is a clear breach of contract, and still Learndirect are not issuing a refund. Considering I paid nearing ¬£1300 for this course, I will be taking all means of trying to get my money back.

Deciding to purchase this course was not something that came lightly. It took months of consideration before I convinced myself to do it as a means of going back to university in the future. Now, as punishment for deciding to try and get back into education, I have lost half of my savings and more than a months pay. This is salt in the wound especially at a time where my income is less than normal and job security isn't certain.

I am writing a letter back to Alison now which I will be sending out tomorrow, and thought I would leave my experience here at the same time.

As they are a local recruiter near to where I live in Bournemouth, I also found it interesting to read the job advertisement and discover that they work on a commission basis. This is definitely reflective of my experience with their customer service team and their lack of empathy. 

If you are signing up to a course with this company and expect your consumer rights to be respected, you might want to think twice before investing.",Person,,Emily Preston,https://uk.trustpilot.com/users/5f36525dd40e1589d0a319d0,Thing,learndirect Limited,Organization,Trustpilot,https://uk.trustpilot.com,Rating,1

1917,Review,2020-08-13T18:45:59+00:00,English and Maths Level 2,en,"I have enrolled on the combined English and Math Level two course with exams and support included. 

I have only just started this course.  But I can honestly say that It is a pleasant experience already.  The online portal is easy to navigate with clear instructions to follow. Both English and Maths topics are clear and concise Each element has a tutorial followed by Practice exercises to check your understanding, answers to the exercises are available for you to check against your answers At the end of each unit there is a quiz to complete to show your understanding.

If you require assistance at anytime, There is a dedicated  support team who you can call or email at anytime throughout your course.  Contact details are provided when you enrol

If you have purchased support with your course Then a dedicated tutor will be assigned to you.  For the English and Maths course they will mark and return any mock exams.  With this particular course you have the option of taking both exams at home or in one of their centres.


‚ÄòThis course is ideal if you got a poor grade in your GCSE‚Äôs or, like myself, missed out altogether.

He is a customer service manager who won‚Äôt talk to customers and takes 2 weeks to reply to emails. He also doesn‚Äôt even read the emails correctly because my first email stated my request clearly and he completely miss read it! 

UPDATE-
I spoke with an advisor today who paused 
my call recording to tell me that this happens all the time and it‚Äôs really annoying because she works in sales, I should go to Ofcom and that David Cox and Zoe won‚Äôt do anything because she always sends complaints through to them. Little do Learn Direct know that I was also recording this call :) 

Sham of a company !! My wife signed up to a course and 4 days later got offered a job that advised they would pay for the course but it has to be done through the council, we tried for ever to call them but kept getting a voice mail for a call back, no call back! Went on the website to request a call back, no call back! Went on the website and acted like we wanted to buy something and guess what? Someone called us as quick as you could say go but couldn‚Äôt help with cancelling the course! Said he sent an email to someone to call but but guess what? No call was received. We sent emails to them to be told we had to ring but when advised we couldn‚Äôt get through was told that this was the only way. In the end on the 13th day we went to the bank and told them what‚Äôs gone on, they blocked them taking money and gave us the deposit back! Now we are having threatening emails saying they will send dept collectors if we don‚Äôt pay, I spoke to someone called Zoe who pretty much just kept saying it‚Äôs after 14 days so she can‚Äôt cancel it, when I told her my story she said that they have been really busy and the phone lines have been busy so this is why we couldn‚Äôt get through. I don‚Äôt see how this is fair and now we have to folk the bill for something we tried to cancel? Mr Cox the manager is extremely rude and unhelpful just demanding we pay and that we have had contact twice according to their systems, their systems are wrong because the only call we had was when she signed up and when I managed to get someone to call me from sales when trying to cancel!

The 14 day Cancellation is a fraud, as the moment u start ur course u cannot cancel under any circumstances. Please be mindful of these scammers. They were very disrespectful asking me if I am done crying yet before hanging up the phone.
I am a single mom on universal credit I can't afford this but they don't care and was not interested in listening.They speak to u in a patronising way and hang up the phone twice because I started to cry and asked for a diploma course transfer instead of certificate of achievement. Both Julie and her colleagues stated that it was my fault for not understanding the cancellation policy. Which clearly stated u have 14 days to cancel which involves 3%admin fee otherwise after 14days it's 50% of course fee for cancellations. It didnt state not to start the course.
I signed up for Health and Social Care level 3 for over ¬£340 on July 30th 2020. I rang learn direct customer representative today August 12th 2020 to cancel the course, after completing 14 modules as I was told it is a level 3 diploma by the manager David who rang to ask if everything was ok on July 31st. He also promised to ring the following Friday to see if all is well. Unfortunately I didn't receive a call or voice message only an email stating if there is any concern I should contact them on a generic email.
This is not a course that will enable you to progress in your jobs or move up the career ladder and it is not recognised in the field of health and social care, as a certificate of achievement is not equivalent to a diploma.

I would not recommend this company. They take your money then ignore or lie about what they offered you originally, they refuse to cancel or refund courses that are not up to standard.
This is the worse company I have ever dealt with and I will be adding a formal complaint to their list.
I have spent endless hours trying to contact them, either via phone or email. If I ever do manage to get through, I'm told that the manager is dealing with my complaint, therefore customer services can not do anything. I have to add, the manager is rude and unhelpful. I've wrote a formal complaint letter to head office, but have not yet received a response. However, I am receiving threatening emails and phone calls demanding the rest of the money.

Firstly I would like to say how incredibly helpful the team members are. Everytime I call the student services helpline, I'm greeted with a professional and helpful demeanor and staff have gone above and beyond to assist me.

The course structure is great. I completed a foundation maths GCSE and struggled my entire life with Maths. I can do these modules, in my own time as frequently as I wish until moving on to the next. The content is concise, it gives you exactly what your brain needs to remember and makes revising straightforward. 

The courses will not teach you motivation, initiative or pragmatism. You bring those ingredients yourself, to contribute the sucess in completing the course. One would be expected to go and reasearch a chosen subject, or borrow books from the library to provide alternative understandings as would be expected in a brick and mortar institute; the courses demand no less.

I'd recommend the course for any adult who want the flexibility to study and to upskill through manageable means.",Person,,Gabriella Golden,https://uk.trustpilot.com/users/5af453d34de5666d34bb8df2,Thing,learndirect Limited,Organization,Trustpilot,https://uk.trustpilot.com,Rating,5

Do your research first. If you need funding to do this course they are not eligible for that so despite what the website says you will have to self fund it. I also found the feedback on the message system a bit blunt so if you are looking for a personal touch this is not for you.

I still am no further forward. That's why I left a negative review because I'm feeling ignored. And honestly I will not recommend LearnDirect based entirely on this experience.

********


I didn't want to write a negative review but as I am being ignored by the company I feel I have no other course of action. In May I signed up to the Nursing course but decided I wasn't ready for it so cancelled within 14 days. I was told on the phone by Claire in customer service I'd get refunded the ¬£9.99 sign up fee within 30 days. On 2nd June LearnDirect deducted ¬£160.70 from my bank account. I complained and received an email a few days later saying I would again get a refund within 30 days. It is now 5th August and I have not heard from the company despite numerous emails, and still haven't received my refund. 

My advice to anyone is be very, very careful dealing with this company. They seem quick to take your money but very slow to refund. I understand issues with coronavirus and remote working but I was still told 30 days and it's been more than 60. Like everyone I'm short of money so hate losing money for no reason. I had planned on signing back up at a later date but now I wouldn't touch LearnDirect at all.",Person,,Victoria,https://uk.trustpilot.com/users/55a0cdfb0000ff0001cbf6bb,Thing,learndirect Limited,Organization,Trustpilot,https://uk.trustpilot.com,Rating,1

Then my life took a serious turn and I became a single parent completely out the blue. 
I contacted learndirect through email and text explaining my dire circumstances and requested a call. Nothing.
I rang but the lines were busy and
so left a message as directed explaining things and requested some - ANY! - form of contact and not to take payment as I could no longer afford the course. 
Nothing.
I contacted the payments dept who in turn put me through to complaints who then basically said ""nope, can't help you!"". 
I physically CANNOT afford this course and I do not have the time or energy to complete it.
One member of staff I did manage to speak to actually SNIGGERED when she told me I was over the 14 day cancellation period. 
To say I am disgusted and livid is a major understatement. 
I am now down ¬£160 which I really cannot afford.

2100,Review,2020-07-29T11:26:37+00:00,Poor Quality. Don't waste Your Money,en,"I enrolled on the Word Advanced 2016 course with a view to also enrolling on the Excel and Outlook courses. I'm pretty IT competent but with no official qualifications, I basically needed something on my CV to show I had done some recent training and a certificate to show as proof to potential employers.

These courses seemed ideal and the courses description stated that on completion I would 'receive' a certificate. Perfect!

Except that the course is abysmal. All it consists of is a series of short videos one after the other. No interactive tasks, no quizzes, no mini tests and you don't even need to complete the self-assessment to achieve a pass. My total learning time, as logged on their site, was 23 mins!!! 

My time would have been better spent watching a series of YouTube tutorials. However, you can't put YouTube on a CV and it doesn't gain you a certificate. The course was a joke but at least I would 'receive' a certificate, and I could just go off to do my own self-study.

But no! I would only receive a certificate if I paid an additional ¬£25!! What a con. This was not mentioned in the description at all. I paid ¬£31 for the course which was an alleged discount from ¬£51. So they would be making the original price with a few extra quid in their pocket.

You can, however, use your own paper and ink to download a poxy printed out certificate, that frankly, isn't worth the paper it's printed on.

I didn't download it and contacted customer service to ask for a refund. No, was their very blunt answer, due to the fact I'd completed the course. So I paid ¬£31 to print a piece of paper.

In the mid-200s I had a positive experience with Learndirect. I did a fully funded City & Guilds L2 Maths course. That's why I didn't think to check reviews now. I still thought they were a quality learning provider. I notice they are also affiliated with the very dodgy stonebridge college. If I'd have known this, I wouldn't have touched them with a bargepole.

Also, by asking students to leave 5 stars reviews for a chance to be entered into a prize draw is a great way to get 5 star reviews from people who have literally just enrolled and can't assess their full experience. 

Seriously, dont waste your money.",Person,,Victoria Ann,https://uk.trustpilot.com/users/5c3141f3b948c2a1faf14c7f,Thing,learndirect Limited,Organization,Trustpilot,https://uk.trustpilot.com,Rating,1

Every step was incredibly helpful, easy and pleasant. Once enrolled onto my course I was delighted at the amount of extra support learn direct offers including a personal tutor, additional learning material, progress tracking and the option to discuss work with other students, there have also been several follow up messages and phone calls to ensure I'm happy with everything I've received and to offer additional support if required.

I genuinely cannot put into words how angry I am!! I have been looking into doing Maths and English functional skills so I could go on to do Veterinary Nursing...I was sold the 2 courses at ¬£64 a month. I was told these were on offer and down from ¬£1,000 to ¬£600 for 9 months...brilliant or so I thought! 2 months in and I find out these did not include exams and they are and additional ¬£225 each!!! So really they aren't on offer are they because that takes it up to over ¬£1,000. I was led to believe by doing what I was doing I would gain the qualifications I needed...I however was not told of the EXTRA cost!! To be quite honest the course content was definitely not worth ¬£600 and I could have got that out of a book!! 2 poxy hours with a tutor is nothing!! What's worse is they now expect me to pay 50% of the remaining fees to cancel!! Covid at the minute is not helping my financial situation and now this!!!

They have been ignoring me when I've tried contacting them about cancelling I have now gone past my 14th day but as I have proof of attempted cancellation I can use that to help fight my case. I also have screenshotted call logs and recorded a call that went to voicemail (even though they basically called me a liar and said there was no record of my number on there call logs). In line with the Consumer Rights Act 2013 I am entitled to free cancellation and a full refund! So definitely contact Trading Standards as they can help and they also pass on the information to third parties. If you Google Learndirect it also comes up with Ofsted reporting them as inadequate and there is also numerous of articles of fraud. Not looking so well for them!! Don't give up fighting as that's what they want. They will be receiving my letter hopefully in a couple days with printed of documents of our agreement and emails highlighting the important parts. Also to cancel don't ring them like they advise you to do. My agreement said to cancel it has to be in writing (although a lady from Stonebridge said it can't be) Trading Standards made it clear they've made a breach of contract. Send a letter to there address which you will find on there website in the Terms and Conditions section and make sure you send it on recorded delivery and keep a copy and if possible email them too the exact same thing. They can't ignore you then as you are exercising your rights and they will only be digging themselves a bigger hole.

Enrolment was quick and easy. I enrolled on Friday and by the following Monday had been fully registered and booked a date to sit my exam. 

I had one issue with logging into my account and contacted my course advisor who quickly arranged for the customer service team to resolve the issue and I was able to log back in straight away.

Online content is good and easy to follow. I have been able to access all information I need and have access to a practice exam which will contribute effectively to my revision and self assessment before completing my exam.

However the handbook for my course was 3 years old and was supposed to help you with the learner portal, but it no longer looks or functions like stated in the manual which made it confusing and useless. Plus I work Monday to Friday 9 to 5 which is the only time they are open to speak to a tutor for support. Which means I don't get instant support from a tutor during the evenings or weekend. You have to email and wait till they are open for a reply. For example, if I asked a question about 6pm Friday I won't get a response till sometime Monday, or due to the 24 hour response time, it could end up being Tuesday.

I have had nothing but a terrible experience with learn direct. The customer service was absolutely terrible. The study materials is the only positive, as they were easy to follow however I feel SCAMMED! I was never once made aware that my exams were not apart of my monthly payments and the book executive that dealt with my enrolment had me under the impression that they were. When I wanted to do my exams they tried getting ¬£500+ more out of me! I have now been trying to make a complaint and get the mistake on their end rectified for about 2 weeks and I have no had no correspondence through from the customer services manager at all and now I am forced to leave this review in hopes that someone from their team will bother to contact me. Because of this, I was unable to go through with the job I applied for, they‚Äôve put my life on hold. As you can imagine during this pandemic, nobody would want to pay a lot a month for something that is definitely not worth it. Why would I pay monthly for a course and then not be able to take my exams? It‚Äôs absolutely not worth hard earned money especially because of the stress i‚Äôm facing due to this pandemic, and the booking executive had me under the impression that it was all included. I refuse to make any more monthly payments until I get some correspondence. I want all my money refunded and this all cancelled OR add in my exams like YOUR employees made me believe!

When threatened by the advertising standards agency, they promptly made a simple 20 question test. Nothing practical to achieve just some questions to answer. Only problem was there was only one answer so you couldnt get it wrong! Hung the phone up on me. Refused to reply to my emails. Only panicked when I got advertising standards involved and created that dire assessment.",Person,https://user-images.trustpilot.com/5b434b934de5666d340b776e/73x73.png,Kieran,https://uk.trustpilot.com/users/5b434b934de5666d340b776e,Thing,learndirect Limited,Organization,Trustpilot,https://uk.trustpilot.com,Rating,1

For one unit I was told my draft was really good and very detailed, and to submit it straight away. I did and failed. The feedback was that my work was not detailed enough. The tutor was also the assessor.  Very frustrating that she failed me on the very thing she‚Äôd praised the work for, while advising me to submit it. Trying to get decent feedback is like pulling teeth. Also trying to get help and advice on other matters leaves you with similar feelings. Passed from pillar to post, before being referred back to the person you emailed for advice in the first place, then that person says they can‚Äôt help and refers you to someone else again. It‚Äôs like they really can‚Äôt be bothered to deal with you once they have your money. I would not recommend Learn Direct to anyone looking for an online platform for their course. When you attempt to cancel the course because of their poor service, you‚Äôre then charged 50% of the remaining balance. A bit rich in my eyes, when their poor service is the reason you want to withdraw.
It should also be noted that they offer the chance to win a free course if you review them on here as soon as you start your course. Of course, feeling excited about your new course, you give them a decent review, with no real idea of what's coming, in the hope that you‚Äôll win.

It seems that they are eager to take your money but not so eager to answer the phone when either you need help or want to cancel. In the end i have ended up calling my bank to block all transactions with Learn Direct, maybe they could compose a course on how to answer the phone? After reading some of the other negative reviews on Trust Pilot i was concerned that nobody can get through to either cancel or get help, being made to feel thick by the course leaders. 

Very disappointed that it has come to this, advertising the course as being the cheapest on the net when it isn't should be a crime also.

I'm halfway through my access course and can't wait to be done with the staff that work here. 
The assessors are sarcastic and make you feel stupid if you ask them to clarify a question or explain their feedback in further detail. I got told ""it's common knowledge and I should know that"". They are there to help you but it's obvious they don't want to. 
They make you feel guilty for asking for extensions for genuine reasons and tell you off as if you're a naughty child in school and not a paying, adult customer with real life issues. I think the assessors forget they're speaking to paying customers not teenage students. 
The customer service department and ""Learner Support"" (if it can even be called that) are blunt and completely uninterested in what you have to say and don't call you back if you request it.
For spending over ¬£1000 on a course I would expect the customer service to be 5 stars but it's literally the worst I've ever experienced from any company.

2372,Review,2020-06-25T22:21:24+00:00,Outrageous!!,en,"Following a conditional uni offer for Sep, I needed to take a functional skills English course to meet the requirements. I was advised to do this by the uni with learn direct. In January after a very brief conversation using the chat window on their website, where I explained I wanted to enrol on this course and why, I was told it cost approx ¬£350 and asked by an agent if they could phone me to take a card payment, which I did. The agent told me I would receive an email with a log in and could go from there, simple?...
I did receive the email with my username and password and this is pretty much the only thing I ever  received from them apart from a brief email about expectations. So, not needing my hand held I began to work through the e-learning, which is, aside from all my other issues with this provider the most awful, frustrating thing I have ever done!! The format is outdated and I found the content disappointing, but I needed it for my place so I continued to work through it. Come April I had finished the online material, much slower than I had expected to, due to how frustrating and absolutely tedious I found it. I scoured my inbox to find some info I had missed from learn direct, there was none. I contacted them via email to explain I had finished the material and what were the next steps as I had never had any guidance or info, I had an email back telling me the name and email of my tutor and to contact her which I did. I was sent a couple of mock papers which I did and returned and then you have the long wait for results and what to do next. I finally managed to book in for a zoom tutorial with my allotted tutor on the 8th June, half way through this it was mentioned that as all the test centres are closed due to covid-19 that I would have to take the exam at home and that would be more expensive?? I asked what was meant by this and was only told at this point, 6 months in!! that there was an exam and I would have to pay extra for this. I asked my tutor how much this was as it was the first I had heard and she said she didn't know. I explained the above to her and she suggested that I contact LD as they should make it very clear that what I paid does not cover the exam, there is an exam and I would have to pay for it. Let me make it very clear, learn direct have never told me anything! When I explained to her, she said an email is normally sent by her with hints and tips etc at the start of the course, I stated I had not had this and she agreed as it was me who had to make contact with her because... I had never had any info. So I contacted learn direct with my obvious issue of not being told that I had to pay and just had a one line email fired back with it's ¬£285, hope that helps. Well it did not! I emailed again and asked why I have never been told any of this before now, why have I never had a receipt, or an invoice or a payment breakdown or anything at all? no reply. This is the beginning of a long pattern now that I email LD and am on the whole ignored. So 2 weeks ago I emailed and explained all of the above, again, that I do not have ¬£285 with no notice, no time to budget or save.  I email them again asking how to escalate this and make a formal complaint, now I get a response, I am assured that this is now being looked in to. Again I have to send multiple emails to ask if this has been looked at, AND finally I am offered a discount of 45% on the exam fee. If this is not acceptable then I have to write a letter to head office. I then agree that it will have to be alright as time is moving on and I need to complete this by the beginning of Sept. What I didn't mention is that I was also only told on the phone tutorial that it is a very long process to book this 3 part exam, a few weeks for the provisional mark, another wait for a confirmed mark and then another month for the certificate. So having accepted the discount of 45% I ask how to book and am sent an email stating it's ¬£285 to book? I email again and say that the discount hasn't been applied and am told it has already been applied as the true cost of the exam is actually ¬£415? Now seen as the learn direct staff can barely reply to an email, I struggle to see how weeks earlier, before I had even asked to complain, when I simply enquired what the price was and was told ¬£285, that the agent could foresee a complaint being made and had already speculatively have applied a discount I had not yet asked for or mentioned? If a discount had been applied would it not have been an idea to put this in the email?
I am absolutely disgusted by this whole arduous process and have found it extremely stressful. 
Maybe I will get a response on here about how they are sorry I'm disappointed?
Providers of any service need to be upfront and honest about all charges, before any money is handed over. I do not dispute that the exam has a cost, my issue is that I was not told this at any point until 6 months in to the course, where I am now trapped!",Person,,Ami Evans,https://uk.trustpilot.com/users/578e28ce0000ff000a331f2c,Thing,learndirect Limited,Organization,Trustpilot,https://uk.trustpilot.com,Rating,1

2449,Review,2020-06-18T19:15:00+00:00,Very disappointed with Learn Direct üò¢,en,"I started my Level 3 Teaching Assistant  course in February. I had my placement agreed, and was attending regularly, I was making decent head way, progressing really well ahead of deadlines and I was really enjoying my course!

 Unfortunately Covid 19 closed the schools. Which could not be helped but you would think being an online course this wouldn‚Äôt be an issue and students could progress with their online assignments and pick up the practical later when back to school.

Unfortunately this is not the case. As a response to this they will allow students to go ahead and complete assignments, out of sequence, however we are not able to submit for marking. As assignments are marked in ‚Äòorder‚Äô and some are practical based ones.

This is so de motivating that the whole course has come to a stop, and I now have assignments backed up to be marked which I can‚Äôt submit until September. It‚Äôs been a nightmare getting hold of anyone to advise. 

David Cox did email back finally, but offered no resolution to this problem and no indication to the way they mark the assignments will change to match the current situation.

So for now my course is at a stand still and I‚Äôm still paying my monthly payments, which doesn‚Äôt seem right. Payments should be frozen if they can‚Äôt meet the needs of students at this time. 

Surly the students work could be marked according, so we can see our pass percentage increase and pick up the practical in September when our placements commence.

I am not the only student who feels let down by this system, it is very disappointing, and de motivating and not being able to get hold of anyone makes a bad situation 100 times worse!

I was nervous signing up to an online course as I have never done one before. Obtaining my degree (BA hons)  at university and other college qualifications through the local college. Seems I was right to be nervous and wish I hadn‚Äôt enrolled on an online course which is not as it appears.",Person,https://user-images.trustpilot.com/5eac7984672772102adcdee9/73x73.png,Rebecca ,https://uk.trustpilot.com/users/5eac7984672772102adcdee9,Thing,learndirect Limited,Organization,Trustpilot,https://uk.trustpilot.com,Rating,1

I enrolled on a course yesterday, costing ¬£1600, which is to be paid in instalments, however I realised today, it is not the right course for me
I managed to speak with a representative Zoey this morning, and asked her to cancel the course. 
I have to say, their representatives have an unpleasant attitude. 
However, she sent me the cancellation form to fill in, which I did.
I noticed at the bottom of the form, it said if one of their cancellation team try to call me, to discuss and I miss the call, my cancellation is not valid.
I had my phone by me ALL DAY, nobody called, or emailed to confirm my cancellation. 
Yet I received an email telling me that someone had tried to call me this afternoon. 
I have proof on my phone, nobody called.
I have since tried to get hold of someone over the phone, but nobody answers. I leave messages, but nobody replies. 
After reading the experiences of the others who tried to cancel I assume this company will fraudulently take money from my account?
I will be involving my solicitor in this case.

David, thankyou for your reply, I have now emailed the customer service email you gave me here. 
I have proof that I have cancelled, I have the email with cancellation form from your company, and I have emailed customer services now tonight. All within the 14 days as per your terms and conditions. 
I spoke to a representative too before hand, so I do not expect any money to be taken from my account. I am legally allowed to  cancel and have followed your terms and conditions.

UPDATE 

I NEVER DID GET MY ¬£30 DEPOSIT REFUNDED AS PROMISED BY THIS COMPANY. IT IS  NOW 4 MONTHS LATER. 
VERY GLAD I DIDN'T PAY FOR THE ENTIRE COURSE UPFRONT AS I DOUBT I WOULD HAVE RECEIVED IT BACK EITHER.

THE WORST COMPANY I HAVE EVER HAD THE MISFORTUNE OF DEALING WITH.

*** FULL OF FAKE REVIEWS ***
I received an email a day or two after enrolling on my course offering to enter me into a prize draw if I left a 5 star review! Believe me, a ZERO star review is far too much.
Have a look at how many of the 5 star reviews say things like '...just started...', '...looking forward to it...', '...so far, so good...', etc.

I would also recommend looking at the company on glassdoor dot co dot uk (no links allowed on TP) and also, try googling 'learndirect ofsted', pay particular attention to the BBC articles.

I was sold a course that is completely inappropriate as I was told it was for a beginner but a lot of the coursework relies on you already working in such a role!?
I tried calling for days on end with no answer, tried to contact my tutor, who has still not answered after 4 weeks!
I sent numerous emails with limited response and advice to write a letter.
I sent the letter on 18th May and have not even received an acknowledgement on 6th June!
I have sent another email today (6th June) and expect I will not receive a response!
THIS COMPANY IS A FRAUD, THEIR CLAIMS ON THE WEBSITE ARE LIES AND THEIR 'CUSTOMER SERVICE' IS NON-EXISTENT. I AM DISGUSTED WITH LEARNDIRECT!!

**** UPDATE 18th February 2021 ****
I have paid the balance on my account and have emailed demanding the removal of all my personal details from their records. I am glad to final cut ties with this shambolic company. I hope they go under, the world is better off without scam companies like this

***** UPDATE 8TH JUNE 2020 *****
I have tried calling the 'help'line today, no answer - asked to leave a message, which I did, no response to my email but as you can see from the reply below, I have been advised to email them, which I have done, 5 times so far.
To give a timescale - my course started on 16th March, I tried calling several times, left messages for my tutor, sent a 'form' through on the website, still no answer, tried calling and was cut off, eventually spoke to a person on 19th MAY!!! Who requested I send her copies of the emails and approximate dates I called, etc. It is now 8th JUNE! It has been 12 weeks that I have been trying to contact someone and leaving messages. I anticipated some issues due to COVID-19 but it appears this company is just a shambles.

I think the reviews on here are rigged too as I received an email (on the day the course started) asking me to leave a 5 star review for the chance to win a course - as the email states ""*You will be entered into a draw and the winner will be drawn and contacted at the end of March 2020. Course up to value of ¬£750.00.""
Call me cynical but if I haven't been able to contact them since March, I doubt anyone has won that... also, would they WANT TO?

***** UPDATE 15th June 2020 *****
Having emailed David Cox, I have received no reply, I have also left 2 telephone messages during the week and have had no response, I am not even able to speak to a human-being once again as the line just rings for ages and then asks you to leave a message, just like the first 3 weeks after I started the course. This company is a complete shambles.

***** UPDATE 23rd June 2020 *****
Another week, another lack of response from anyone. I emailed David Cox with times, dates, etc. I didn't keep a record of every single call I have placed to Customer 'Services' as I didn't think I would need to at the start of all this, furthermore after 14 weeks, I think my pen would've run out. I'm very tempted to cancel the Direct Debit, I'm sure they would be in touch then.

***** UPDATE 29TH JUNE 2020 *****
It seems they pay more attention to their Trustpilot review than any emails or phone calls (which they don't answer anyway). I have, maybe as a direct result of the above update or maybe not, received an email today telling me they are sorry for the way I have been treated but essentially 'tough, you've signed a contract and didn't cancel within 14 days' which is an interesting conundrum; if I have been unable to contact anyone despite the numerous emails, phone calls, etc within 14 days - how am I supposed to do it? Short of inventing a time machine, I don't think it is possible. Surely this means, I could sign someone up to a non-existent course and tell them that if they don't contact me within 14 days, they are stuck with it and then simply - NOT ANSWER THE PHONE! Hmmm... maybe I have discovered their business model. I am forced to pay the course off or take legal action. Quite frankly, I have already spent 4 months trying to sort this out so I am just going to pay the money and cut all ties.
Please, do not sign up to a course with this company without first reading the reviews on this site and, if it is 5*, ask yourself, why the massive disparity? For example, there is a review from 'Denise' - ""Great service.

I immediately stopped accessing the online course,  I called them several times, sent emails and posted letter to them. Explained to them I don't need the course because I had been offered an admission by the university contrary to their advice. 
Learn direct has put me into financial, emotional 
and psychological  difficulties since my encounter with them last year. 
They never stopped threatening me with emails, text messages and letters.  They kept taking money from my account. Even though I have spoken to them on several occasions and agreed on what I could pay monthly.  After making such payment, they still take another money from my account contrary to my agreement with them putting me into Financial difficulties. 
Learn direct is fraudulent organisation,  don't trust their advisers. They could go to any length to ensure they deceive you to fall for their lies in order to get your money.

Absolutely appalling service, not that I would call it 'service'. I bought a course/exam bundle and was appalled at the interface. My husband is an IT professional and also found it appalling, not to mention not working/functioning correctly despite multiple browsers. Simple solution, withdraw and request a refund! Not so simple!. The request for a refund was sent in early April 2020, and as days and weeks passed, no response. Eventually, I started to call combined with emails. Each time I phoned I was told the same thing - "" We are processing your refund and it will be with you in 30 days, we have tried to contact your wife"" - despite checking the phone number and email held for my wife, no contact was made.

Course material is perfect in my opinion although some of the tutors could do with a kick up the bum in regards to support and help! Im working my way though it nicely and the website is easy to navigate. 

As for customer service i have never known a company like it! I sent an email to the finance department a month ago and am still yet the get a response! Dont bother requesting a call back ive been trying that for 3 weeks! When you call you only get 3 mins on the phone before being sent to voicemail and if you leave one it will be ignored. Today i finally managed to get through to someone who clearly had just rolled out of bed working from home! She was rude and very unhelpful! Long pauses between what i was saying and what she was saying hasnt got a clue how to do her job! I was asking about the advanced learner loans available as we are struggling financially during covid-19 and she sniggered at me whilst telling me they are no longer accepted when i sounded shocked that the website says otherwise!! 
Do you accept them or not?? Either update your staff or update your website! 

Quick enough to take your money but no financial help whatsoever during hard times! 

If there was a complaint option on the phone line - which there isnt- I would have made one about the rude lady who i spoke to today!! 

Before enrolling do some research! Luckily i am quite an independant person who doesnt often have to call customer support but for someone who needs more contact and support then this company would be no use at all. 

Like i said the acrual course and its material i cant fault one bit and im so glad i enrolled but i just think for the amount we actually pay we should be treated with a bit more respect",Person,,Amber Grayston,https://uk.trustpilot.com/users/5ea6bc43a9b71c5b484d4869,Thing,learndirect Limited,Organization,Trustpilot,https://uk.trustpilot.com,Rating,2

I had a pop up on the website with a man who persistently tried to persuade me into the course. I then agreed and he took a ¬£20 deposit. Because of my mental health and financial sitaution at the time I felt I was unable to complete the course and phoned up to cancel. The man on the phone assured me I had cancelled, but here we are and I have a threatening letter saying I owe ¬£1,444 because I cancelled AFTER the 14 day grace period. LearnDirect have no reccolection nor records of said phone call even though I have on numerous attempts told them I had cancelled. (In hindsight I WISH I had recorded that phone call). Now here I am. Unable to still pay with this current circumstances affecting the economy and my wage. Yet the advisors keep persisting I did not cancel and that I now need to pay ¬£120.33 per month for a course I have not opened nor enaged in ONCE. So why am I being charged? They have NO costs associated with my course as I have not completed ANY materials nor used a tutor that they offer. So I have cost them NOTHING. The way they speak to you is atrocious, no sympathy, hardly ANY understanding of current circumstances. Surely they'd take initiative and think that if a person hasn't opened the course or used any material nor done ant coursework/assignments after 7 months of being enrolled. That they had cancelled or were not planning on completing the course. I ended up blocking their number as my anxiety cannot deal with these people. They're making me feel increasingly depressed and more suicidal with each threatening letter they send. I spoke to CAB about the letters and even they agreed that they come off as over-threatening and harrassing and that they are potentially breaching the law with their methods of retrieval. I have no plans on paying for this course and would advise EVERYONE that unless you're 110% sure you want to learn with them, I'd avoid them like the plague.",Person,,Daniel,https://uk.trustpilot.com/users/5c158ce5f1aed24880e7c5e1,Thing,learndirect Limited,Organization,Trustpilot,https://uk.trustpilot.com,Rating,1

2770,Review,2020-04-08T20:47:54+00:00,Waste of money !!!!!! With incorrect grammar,en,"Dear Learn Direct

I am very disappointed in the learning package English level 2 . English is my home language and hold a medical diploma level 5 ,but I need to obtain a Level 2 equivalent to GCSE for UK application for university, hence my reason for purchasing your product ,but it has not met my expectations as a learning tool.
Firstly, I notice that some of the questions use incorrect grammar or having spelling mistakes. You are given a score at the end of each section but at no time does the program let you know where you have gone wrong and why so  ? At the end of the session you have learnt nothing other than you have given the incorrect answer - this does not enhance your learning.

I challenged my English speaking 63 year old mum who has worked as a PA / Administrator for 45 years as well as another professional working friend to see how they scored  with the sessions and guess what they both failed level 1/2  and agreed that the program is not helpful as it doesn't teach you anything and neither of them could fathom where they had gone wrong and why when they both have English qualifications.

I think the course has been a waste of my time and money.  I have not learnt anything.  It has caused me frustration and anxiety and I am no closer to achieving my goal which is to obtain a GCSE ‚Ä¶..

In view of the above I  would like a refund because the course is and not helpful at all ,considering it's to teach English and holds incorrect grammar and spelling errors I am truly disappointed .

2782,Review,2020-04-06T20:55:08+00:00,Learn direct appear to be very good,en,"Learn direct appear to be very good, until you have a problem!

 I signed up to a course on 23rd February 2020, I then decided, after 5 days to cancel this course as is my statutory right to do so within 14 days. Learn direct did try to retain me as a customer but I remained firm on canceling. They then took 1 week to confirm via email that they had cancelled my course, they then advised that my refund would take up to 30 days!! In what world does it take 30 days to process a refund? 

From the 5th of March, I have awaited my refund which Learn Direct have failed to provide. I have called them and left 2 voicemail plus an email. 

Today I realised that if you press 2 on their options when calling (existing customers) nobody answers and you are prompted to leave a voicemail, but if you press option 1, (new customers) somebody answers instantly! This just shows exactly where their priorities are, if they've had your money - they don't care about you! 

Upon speaking to a man using option 1, he transferred me to customer services, they stated that I should have been refunded and she needed to speak to accounts, I asked how she was going to get back to me, as she seemed very keen to get me off the phone, she stated that she would get back to me via email later today, she HASN'T! 

I have had my money stolen by Learn Direct, and now I have to chase them daily to find out where it is? It's an absolute joke, I would also like to add that they have plagued my phone and emails asking where MY payment is for the course! I cancelled after 5 days! This is nothing to do with the current world situation, my refund was requested way before that. I would NEVER use them again. 

Where is my money???

UPDATE: 20TH APRIL 2020

Today, just when I thought that Learn Direct could not get any worse, they did! 
I received a threatening letter from them, stating that I owe them ¬£334 for the complete course amount because I cancelled my direct debit! 

As previously stated, I cancelled well within the 14 day cooling off period. I then had to open a claim with my bank to get the money back that Learn Direct had taken out of my account, my bank refunded the money after only 2 days because I had proof in the form of an email, stating that Learn Direct had accepted my cancellation. 

I cannot believe that this company operates in such a dreadful manner. I had hoped that my dealings with them were over forever, but apparently not. 

STEER WELL CLEAR! NOBODY NEEDS CHASING FOR DEBTS THAT THEY DON'T OWE IN A WORLD CRISIS, WE CERTAINLY HAVE ENOUGH TO COPE WITH. 

Dreadful company, I will return my letter from them with a very strongly worded response! More time, distress  and effort at my expense.

P.s Learn Direct, don't you DARE respond to this as if you give a toss or respond to people's emails- neither are applicable in your case!",Person,,Eva,https://uk.trustpilot.com/users/5e8b93879ba9f514354dd439,Thing,learndirect Limited,Organization,Trustpilot,https://uk.trustpilot.com,Rating,1

I knew I liked playing with computers and creating worksheets, so I decided to look for a job that involved those skills. 

Everything I was interested in needed a qualification; I felt defeated before I had even started. I needed to re do my English GCSE before even thinking about the required course. Luckily I was already signed up to Learn Direct whom I had recently received an email off offering a FREE! course. I checked it out and enrolled on The English Level 2 Functional Skills. 

The course is amazing, very easy to follow and explains the content extremely well. I have always struggled with English but actually feel like its sinking in. This isn't the best part I also spoke to James on the Learn Direct online chat, he advised me there was no interest to pay! no credit checks! and the first payment wouldn't be due until the 1st of May! but wait there's more! (as quoted in the film Scream) James also said there was an offer on the course I had chosen, 40% off! WOW! All I had to pay was ¬£9.99 enrolment. I was so happy I was able to book onto the course I needed and do the Functional Skills along side it for FREE!

2807,Review,2020-03-27T10:58:30+00:00,Terrible customer service and no refund forthcoming,en,"Initially when I signed up for an online counselling course in March 2020 I was dealt with very well - not surprisingly as I was buying one of Learndirect's products.  The operations manager and one other managed the enrolment process.  I found another more suitable course within the 14 day 'cooling off' period and contacted the operations manager and the staff member to cancel the course, returning unsigned the agreement for the monthly subscription.  I accepted that I would lose the ¬£9.99 deposit paid initially.  I checked my bank statements recently and was horrified to see that 6 x ¬£45.75 monthly payments had been taken from my account.  I have never activated the course nor intended to.
I immediately called Learndirect and there followed many phone calls, emails and ultimately 2 complaint letters from me, one of which mysteriously went astray.  I sent the second letter by recorded delivery and confirmed its safe delivery.  I heard nothing further and once again for the hundredth time contacted Learndirect.  The operations manager with whom I originally dealt was also dealing with my complaint at this stage and sent me a short email saying he thought by cancelling my subscription and closing the course the matter had been satisfactorily dealt with.   This was absolutely not the case.
I had a further exchange of emails with him and others culminating in one representative stating randomly he thought 'James' had offered me another course.  I was also emailed the activation code for the course!
I am in touch with a legal body to pursue this further as I have reached my limit with the level of anxiety caused by this prolonged and agonising contact with Learndirect.
Thanks Trustpilot for allowing me to vent these feelings of frustration and misery!
NB.  I have just received a letter from Learndirect stating that I have been enrolled on the course for too long to be offered a refund or cancellation!!

I have contacted them so many times and they say there is nothing they can do!I am facing a frustrating problem that it seems like no one is planning to resolve. I have spoken on the phone to different people and they all mentioned that there is nothing they can do. When I am going through my lessons, theory questions are connected with practical ones that cannot be completed unless a placement is secured in a nursery setting. Even though all the units are open and I can work on the theory questions, I am unable to get any feedback from my assessor because she says I cannot submit the assignment when the practical questions are missing. I have offered to volunteer full time in nursery settings but all refused due to Covid 19 and they are reducing the number of paid workers let aside volunteers.

How am I expected to finish 23 units not knowing if what I am doing is the right thing?

Pretending to deliver online solutions for courses which their so called tutors are not suited to deliver in such format, generic feedback, unable to be specific when pointed out and arsy attitude when challenged on this! Their systems cannot support modern day technology, file formats are changed when updated and their IT illiterate tutors are unable to see or open, therefore blaming it on the student as no evidence provided. Also be prepared never to pass your assignment if you give them constructive feedback in any form. Absolute waste of my time, resources and money. 

They tell you one thing then never deliver, when you try contact accounts or customer services prepare yourself for at least 6 weeks and two complaints before you get a dismissive answer. Adviser on the telephone promised they would arrange for ¬£100 cashback as I paid for my course. Nothing was ever done about this and my several emails have been ignored about the matter.

As a learning professional myself, I can't stress this enough. Stay away from Learn Direct.",Person,,Abbey,https://uk.trustpilot.com/users/5e67b81dbaa51845bc13d27e,Thing,learndirect Limited,Organization,Trustpilot,https://uk.trustpilot.com,Rating,1

I bought some courses for my Wife 2 months ago. At the point of paying, at no point was I (the person buying) made aware that this did not include the Exams. I was told only after I paid that they were another ¬£250. To say I was unhappy was an understatement (As plainly heard on the call)

I called back to then book these exams a few weeks later to find out they are now ¬£700 +!!! but with their discount it could come down to ¬£380. 

I made a formal complaint as I felt this had been completely miss sold to me. he Operations Manager, who I can only imagine as Rodney from Only Fools and Horses, assumes I did know... even though he's listened to the calls and knows I was never told. He has then proceeded to deliberately ignore my calls and emails for weeks. 32 days and counting and still no resolution.

Long story short, miss selling courses, no customer services, no after care. Just get you to pay and then they couldn't care less. 

The Operations Manager shouldn't be in this role if this is how he sets an example to a team working underneath him.",Person,,Alex McDowell,https://uk.trustpilot.com/users/5dfb70f631bb5a443c8c4217,Thing,learndirect Limited,Organization,Trustpilot,https://uk.trustpilot.com,Rating,1

At no point were me or my wife ever informed by any means that schools would could and very firmly do ask for the person to have already achieved GCSE In both Maths and English. If I/we had known this we would have asked the local schools prior to signing up ¬£500 for the course beforehand. As a result of not being informed enrolling on this course getting to the point of requiring works experience inside a school my Wife Maureen has contacted every local school (6) and not one of them will allow her to get works experience from them without holding this qualification. Contacted Learn Direct David who tried to fob us of with some lame response but still the fact remains we have not been fully informed prior to taking the course fee. Sent a letter (stage3) complaints procedure to the STONEBRIDGE ASSOCIATED COLLEGES in Bude Cornwall who rather pathetically said sorry to hear to are cancelling your study!!! I am requesting for a full refund due to not being informed and the miss-selling/misleading of your product.

After calling the office to cancel I was told that I had to write a letter to the head office. The customer service agent literally told me 'they handle cancellations on an individual basis and depends what mood they are in as to whether they will accept', this after another customer service agent had told me I could do this over the phone (which you can't). This instantly made me question the integrity of the company (having read previous responses on Trust Pilot from Learn Direct, I see you have access to past phone conversation transcripts so would be very happy for you to examine this). I sent off a letter to the head office (which again seems an archaic way of doing business for an online company?) and never received a response back. I haven't been charged anything over the past 10 months so assumed all had been cancelled. That is until suddenly, ¬£120 was debited from my account last month again!?

At the end of each segment you were quizzed and given a percentage 80% to pass ect on some occasions it said failed but due to the countless errors I wasn`t sure if I had failed or was it another error so I started doubting mysef. I spoke to a tutor and was sold they are aware of errors but could not help me as I`d already started. I`ve requested a refund.",Person,https://user-images.trustpilot.com/5a44a7cd0000ff000af72146/73x73.png,David Griffiths,https://uk.trustpilot.com/users/5a44a7cd0000ff000af72146,Thing,learndirect Limited,Organization,Trustpilot,https://uk.trustpilot.com,Rating,1

3476,Review,2019-06-07T11:43:53+00:00,OFSTED RATES INADEQUATE,en,"Please be aware that the request to leave a review immediately after making a purchase is sent by LearnDirect advisors, leading me to believe most are written with little knowledge or actual experience with them. I had been battling with LearnDirect since June 2019 and is now Nov 2019, they have no real complaints procedure with waiting up to 6 weeks at a time for a reply and forced over to what seems their sister company Stonebridge to deal with the matter, to only be directed back. Finally, received a response to my formal complaint that was just another empty apology and not resolving the problem or providing answers to the unnecessary consequences of their very poor actions. I then attempted to take this further with the Financial Ombudsman Service but seeing as I was no longer in contract with LearnDirect, it was not possible. However, newly named CDRL (Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) Services) would be the next step to take, the only downside to this is that the company being LearnDirect in this case, have to engage with the scheme and become a member in order to allow customers unhappy with their initial response to a complaint to take it further. As you could imagine, LearnDirect is not and refuse to fight them any longer if asking them to do so. So please be wary that in the event something does go wrong, your only outcome may be to face whatever decision LearnDirect mustards up after a lengthy period and move on. Have since joined Open Study College whom are fantastic, polite and don't force a narrative of themselves just because they may offered a good deal from the beginning, allowing you to really get a grip of their service to then form your own opinion. Here is a list provided by the National Careers Service a month or two ago for distance learning, even free courses and more, not so surprisingly doesn't include LearnDirect;

Pros:
Very good tutors who provide useful advice and are supportive of your efforts;
Initial course units help to engage the learner into the process of studying, learning and going to university;
Interesting and diverse topics of study.
Most students study for 10 hours per week on average, leaving plenty of time for work and other activities.

Cons:
Late feedback/marking on occasion;
Some study materials lack detail and, on rare occasions, some material was copy-and-pasted straight from other websites (without references).
Some unit assignments required surveys to be conducted or presentations to be made (by video), which this student found difficult.

Conclusion:
I would definitely recommend Learndirect as a means of progressing to university or for general study/learning/career advancement purposes.

3540,Review,2018-10-25T11:34:19+00:00,Excellent staff and Course (Social Science),en,"I have been studying a HE Social Science distance learning course since June 2018. A distance learning course means I can study from home around my busy schedule. 

The staff have all been very supportive and friendly from the start.
Don't be put off by the first few units of the course i.e learning to write a personal statement or regarding the course handbook. I found this all very useful and understood why this was included in the work. 

As you progress in the course you will learn how to write academically so the first few units are useful to practice with. 

Drafts can be sent to tutors before you submit your final assignment. This is very helpful as the tutors do give feedback on any information you may have missed or could change. 

I feel the course material is well laid out and informative. There is a section for addition study material, which is also very helpful. 

It is not necessary to buy books or other study material as it is all online and readily available. But with any course you study it is in your best interest to build your knowledge further by researching. The purpose of studying is so you learn in a way that you remember. I write lots of notes and use flash cards for important points. I also set a time table, use assignment planners and mind maps.

There are a number of online second hand book stores you can buy good quality books from for a decent price or you could ask your local library to order books in for you. You can also search on various websites for the information you need, which costs you nothing. 

If you are motivated in completing a course you have to put in the effort to understanding the topic fully. The tutors are there to help you throughout the course. If you are struggling then ask for their help. 
Should I ever struggle with any of part of my course I am very sure the tutors and the rest of the team would be there for me.

The staff is intimidating and exceptionally rude, they treat people like a lower form of life. I was subject to an extended personal search, I had to show them my pockets and ears several times (for bluetooth devices), and I was asked to roll up my sleeves. I also had to show them that I switched off my mobile because one of the members of staff seemed not to believe me. I wasn't even allowed to finish my cup of water, although my exam was to be sat in 30 minutes. They didn't bother explain anything, they didn't talk to me, let alone a smile. They were asking questions in a cold manner and bullied me around the waiting area. All my moves were constantly watched like if I was a criminal.The atmosphere was very tense and intimidating, more like an interrogation room than the place where you sit an exam. The most arrogant, condescending and vile people I have come across within the educational sector...I strongly advise to avoid this place at all costs.

I did fail near to the end of the 1 year long access to the course when taking the exam for the first time. The course was teaching Version 8 and when it came to the exam, most of the questions where for Version 9 - a very different exam which I was not trained or educated for!  
They did give me 1 retest but I had to beg for it. 
There was not much support along the way, and no follow up to see how you where doing, I had to ring them and some of the staff did try to be helpful but seemed lost in themselves.
This particular course is a difficult one and 1 year to complete it is far too little time. They should give you 2 years as you are only accessing their videos online anyway and other content.

Other people in the course were random people who didn't really need the course, and they knew nothing about the subject. Therefore, I am sure they believed all the erroneous information provided by the tutor, who really made major major mistakes. I didn't want to create trouble so I said nothing, but it was disgusting. I would not recommend any courses by these people to anyone. They even contacted me trying to convince me to take an equal opportunity and sexism related course, and when I mentioned I was a freelance worker thus had no employees, they still said I should still know these things...

I attended & registered for this course during May 2017. I was told to complete an initial maths level 2 assessment & achieved a good 92% pass mark (took 3 hours to complete). I was then asked to return next week in order to complete a maths level 3 assessment (this also took nearly 3 hours to complete). Upon this second visit, I was then told by the tutor that Learn Direct unfortunately could not offer me a GCSE maths equivalent course due to the fact that I scored 92% in my level 2 assessment last week & that if I had achieved a lower score of around 40% then I would have been offered a gcse maths equivalent course. This didn't make sense at all! Naturally, I was very upset & quite angry of the fact I was not told of this after my level 2 assessment I completed last week & i was also informed over the phone during my very 1st enquiry that they 'did' offer a GCSE maths equivalent course! I had made 2 visits to the Learn Direct centre in Birmingham city centre & have wasted nearly 6 hours of my time! (I found out afterwards that I may have been enrolled onto both maths assessments so that Learn Direct could receive government funding.......nice move if it is true!.

One was miles away and though still within my distance limit to get to it started before I could have got there so I'd have been late every morning. 

The second I was told was new and had only been going for a few months and they just sat around doing nothing, so I have no idea what the point of that was was. It was shortly closed by health and safety as it was unsafe any way so I ended up finding my own placement
.
Since working on the placement I have got on very well with the supervisor and am also getting on well with the boss who owns a number of companies, and have been told I have a very good chance at a job at the end of my placement, if I want one with them. 

Now here is the part where LearnDirect confuse me...
They called me to say that jobs are available but only last for 8 weeks and are twisting my arm to take up one. Now they know it's a safe bet that I'll have one with my placement but dont seem to care and just want me to take one that lasts 8 weeks.

If I leave my placement to go and work for someone else for 8 weeks then my chance of working with them is ZERO and I'll be unemployed again just before Christmas. 

I have explained this to them and they dont give a toss.

This is the third time I have had contact with LearnDirect and all 3 times they have offered VERY POOR service. Hope this will be the last time I have to enter a LearnDirect building.",Person,,John Walker,https://uk.trustpilot.com/users/563009e20000ff0001e62d8f,Thing,learndirect Limited,Organization,Trustpilot,https://uk.trustpilot.com,Rating,1
