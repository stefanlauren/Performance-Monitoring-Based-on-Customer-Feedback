12,Review,2021-03-09T12:44:02+00:00,Absolutely appalling,en,"Absolutely appalling. 

I have an exam on Friday and none of my learning materials are accessible as QA's eLearning has been built using flash player. Having done some research flash player is now obsolete, so it won't play in any device or browser!

I phoned QA yesterday afternoon to tell them there was a problem and was told someone would be in touch. 24 hours have now passed and not one person has contacted me since. I've been chasing for the last day without any resolution whatsoever.

Today I contacted them via chat, they said they had no record of my booking and told me to speak to cloud learning. I called QA again and they told me to call someone else on their personal number. I called the person in question 3 times and each time my call was ignored.

I then called the IT line and they told me to call yet another person. I call said person and they won't answer either. I then get passed through to the main switchboard again and after putting me on hold for 10 minutes, they tell me to call the person I just tried to call and isn't answering!

I'm now on a call again to them. The main switchboard passed me to their coursework team, the coursework team then tell me the course is in my eLearning and I'm clicking on the wrong course. I'm not! The one they're referring to which they claim is my eLearning is supplementary learning with 7 updated pieces of information because the course has changed slightly since the course was first issued to me. My course has over 25 modules and I don't have access to any of them!

It shouldn't be this incredibly difficult for an issue like this to be fixed. No one at QA wants to take ownership of the issue or fix with it any urgency, despite having an exam set for 3 days time! Everyone just keeps passing the buck on to someone else or ignoring your calls! 

A new link to the module should have been proactively sent to me before flash player even became obsolete! It shouldn't be up to the candidate to continually beg for days for a new link to be sent so that I can continue to do the learning that my employer has already paid for me to have access to!

EDIT: Sophia - 9301698. This number has been given to 6 different members of staff so far. I look forward to someone finally taking ownership of this situation and resolving the problem by the end of today. I'm utterly sick of this now.",Person,https://user-images.trustpilot.com/5526f1a40000ff0001b74ce8/73x73.png,Olivia,https://uk.trustpilot.com/users/5526f1a40000ff0001b74ce8,Thing,QA Ltd,Organization,Trustpilot,https://uk.trustpilot.com,Rating,1

39,Review,2021-02-04T19:36:51+00:00,Avoid at all cost,en,"Terrible training materials, you're basically on your own.
The exercises (hands on lab) they give you are literally copy and paste (I am not kidding), copy and past this in the IDE and then see what it does.
The CloudAcademy library is complete trash, you watch videos of people reading stuff at you, no pedagogical approach, you end up searching for other websites on internet to learn because everything else is better than what they offer. Then you have a training session once every 3 months, which is fully packed with content and that the teacher rushes to finishes because he doesn't have much time (in 5 days we ""learned"" Python and SQL), you are with 12 other students in the training so you won't have time to ask much question as it needs to move on. Avoid at all cost!
If you don't want to waste your time, energy and money go somewhere else!

edit: QA tried to have my review deleted even though from how accurate it is they knew it wasn't a fake review.
You can be sure they are not trying to having those good reviews deleted. Therefore the scoring is not really representative of what it should really be, I'm sure many reviews were deleted because they didn't like them.

edit2: The more the time goes the more I realize how much of a waste of my time that thing is, I just lost an entire year and missed on serious job opportunities thanks to QA .

To say that I'm disappointed by 9/10 of the providers in this space I have dealt with would be an understatement. That is certainly not the case with QA and more specifically with Helen Anthony who has been exceptional. Her candidate management was first class, the quality of candidate was excellent and was very organised.  In my 12 years I have not come across a more competent Training Provider and would not hesitate in recommending Helen to the wider market.

The customer service is disappointing. Numerous emails sent with no reply with a claim that they'll get back to you within 48 hrs. From experience thats not true.  Then a recommendation to call them which just leads to going straight to voicemail. 

Unfortunately I cannot recommend this organisation.

Then weeks went by with no contact, I tried to contact both of the staff at QA dealing with the role no response via email and won't pick up the phone.

Contacted head office and they can't get me through to them either or talk about the position.

So I resorted to contacting the business who would have been taking me on as an apprentice who have also told me they had been cut off by QA.

My trainer was excellent, he was extremely knowledgeable and able to deliver the course remotely with ease. Any questions that candidates had were addressed immediately and when further explanation was requested it was covered without fuss.
Managing a group of 20+ candidates remotely would be a challenge to most but our trainer was professional and controlled this with ease.
The booking process, pre-course material, delivery of text books and access to session was excellent. QA kept me informed and answered any queries that I raised promptly.
I would highly recommend completing training with them.",Person,,I Smith,https://uk.trustpilot.com/users/5dc28f9c6f972483887e07d5,Thing,QA Ltd,Organization,Trustpilot,https://uk.trustpilot.com,Rating,5

I have completed multiple AXELOS Foundation & Practitioner courses with both QA and also alternative training providers and would highly recommend QA for choice. Overall my experience of their courses has been far superior to cheaper alternative companies offering the same courses. The trainers are both well experienced in the relevant field but also talented trainers who understand how to train a room full of individuals with differing experiences themselves and ways of Learning. The course materials are better structured, more comprehensive in covering the syllabus and better quality in this presentation.
The structure of the day and the week is well organised and admin around organising the actual exams is made as easy as possible with the exams being booked in advance to take place within the week of the course (unlike competitors who have moved away from this to drive down their own costs!).
Although QA has come with a higher price tag than other course providers - they are well worth the money as a cut above the alternatives in supporting you to achieve your course objectives.",Person,,C,https://uk.trustpilot.com/users/5d9f22662f6b8b51e4f84201,Thing,QA Ltd,Organization,Trustpilot,https://uk.trustpilot.com,Rating,5
