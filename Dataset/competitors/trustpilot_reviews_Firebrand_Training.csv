2,Review,2021-06-11T11:17:09+00:00,CIPP/e training,en,"Trainer was very experienced and knowledgeable about the subject, I attended in person but found that he facilitated questions between the classroom and online attendees well and always had time for questions.

Firebrand staff were excellent and nothing was too much, any issues were sorted out promptly and they were all very polite. There were snacks (fruit, sweets and biscuits) and drinks (softdrinks, tea, coffee & water) available throughout the day - as they are very long days this was a lifesaver!

The accommodation was nice at the training centre - although compact, it was pretty modern and comfortable. Updated TVs and having air-con in the rooms would have been a bonus but it didn't detract from the overall experience as I was there for training! 

The food was mostly good, not the best seasoned but edible. Staff at the hotel were excellent, very attentive and socially distanced very well.

Although Firebrand were one of the more pricey options for training I would say the value for money was well worth it in my experience and in the future I will be back.",Person,,GR,https://uk.trustpilot.com/users/59f787ef0000ff000adc0378,Thing,Firebrand Training,Organization,Trustpilot,https://uk.trustpilot.com,Rating,5

1. Print material distributed by post was partly not the same as in the course. This made the paper worthless if you like to take notes - of interest for the open book exam.
2. The online training leveled the monotony of the trainer voice from hypnotizing to deep sleep mode.
3. One of the advantages is that you are usually taken through all required steps to enroll for the exam immediately after the course, fresh. The trainer missed on that one completely so no efficiency gain here but the pain of repeating every thing all over and finding a new time slot outside the reserved training days.

Bottom line: The competitive advantage has disappeared.

54,Review,2021-03-01T10:14:19+00:00,in a word: INTENSE,en,"I'm basing this entire review on one course - so maybe that's unfair. I attended the PL200 ""Power Platform Functional Consultant"" course at the request of my employer.

First off it's really important you know what you're letting yourself in for before you do a course like this - I had just been told by my employer that there was ""some training coming up you should probably get on"" - Firebrand (if this course is anything to go by) are an ""accelerated learning"" provider and that ""accelerated"" is important. You will be expected to completely immerse yourself in the subject - the course expects a 13 hour day commitment as an absolute minimum and you will need extra time to do revision and practice tests outside of that.

I can comfortably say that as somebody entirely new to the Power Platform this was the single most intensive learning experience I have ever had - Go into it realising that you should thoroughly read all the background material beforehand and that you will need to completely devote the duration of the course to the course and nothing else and you will come away with a mountain of knowledge you didn't have before in a very short space of time. Go into it blithely expecting some gentle training and you'll get a rude awakening!

The trainer was massively knowledgable (as they have to be to compress this much learning into such a short space of time) and very friendly and helpful but the theory sessions seemed overlong - there's simply too much to learn and your brain stops soaking it up after an hour or so and the lab sessions seemed a bit short - there was *just* enough time to get through them but not the extra time you need to actually appreciate what you're doing while you're doing it.

In short? The training is INTENSE - prepare for it and know what you're going into and it'll be amazing - you'll learn more than you thought possible in such a short space of time, but you may need paracetamol when your brain starts to bleed.

I'm updating this review just to let you all know that I PASSED the Microsoft exam. Before the course I had dabbled with power platform - made a simple canvas and model driven app but was basically completely new to the D365 universe - 4 days of this course and I passed the exam - so worth every penny I'd say.",Person,,Dom Jones,https://uk.trustpilot.com/users/603cbe7bb04d69001a6e8a23,Thing,Firebrand Training,Organization,Trustpilot,https://uk.trustpilot.com,Rating,4

69,Review,2020-12-24T15:23:28+00:00,De training is a bit short and two exam vouchers are necessary,en,"De training is quite good but not sufficient to pass directly the test, it needs really some weeks of additional training or to have deeply study in advance.
This kind of training would be completed with a pre-study of minimum one month self-study with a daily time around 30 minutes-one hour on specific training like: process management content, attacks & vulnerabilities, cryptographic basis, ... Well, something like two introduction chapter per week to cover each 8 modules on one month.
Comparing CISSP training material, course is covering around 75% of real CISSP content but is a good digest of it.
Exercises are too easy and only centered on the course itself meaning we have no real perception that it can be far more questions and concepts during the tests and IAM part is really too short so as legal part. I had between 70-80% of correct responses on each exercise sets during course and checked all my weak spot, despite this, real exam was covering very differently. The problem is some points are missing is that we are drilled to respond regarding the course and not regarding our knowledge then we can exclude the good answer because not covered despite we know it.
I think it is extremely difficult to succeed the CISSP without the course but I would suggest to keep doing the test at the end but providing two vouchers for CISSP exam and considering the first try as a part of the training because you don't imagine the drama that could be for some student to fail the test. It is good to try it after the drill because, anyway, doing the real exam is a training on itself too.

For the course content, it is nearby impossible to use it for study because containing no matrix, summarization or comparison table. CISSP exam is mainly a 3-way or 4-way analytical questions then it is extremely complicate to build some links during exam. The course doesn't demonstrate enough on MOST, WORST, LEAST, MUST, ... and informed guess is not all the time enough for a MOST or a LEAST for example because you are unsure of the weight to apply on each correct answer (most of the time the 4 are corrects). Or it is not during exam to do a philosophical introspection to choose between one of the seven OSI layers regarding English profound meaning of a word.

Could be good to have the evaluation form in English too ;-)",Person,,Hugues Crepin,https://uk.trustpilot.com/users/5fe4b2708791e4001a4fb507,Thing,Firebrand Training,Organization,Trustpilot,https://uk.trustpilot.com,Rating,3

INITIAL FEEDBACK - 
Extremely disappointed & annoyed! I was really looking forward to the course that I booked with Firebrand, when I had a death in my family and had to raise some cash quickly to cover all the costs associated with it. So I contacted Firebrand to cancel the course and use that money towards the funeral costs. The course was over a month away and when I contacted Firebrand they said they cannot refund the full amount and will have to keep £500+vat. The fact that this was never communicated to me when I signed up was extremely wrong and unethical. Had it been communicated to me before hand I would have been more careful when I joined. It's not the fact that I lost £500+ for almost nothing that annoys me. It's the fact that companies like Firebrand don't care about individuals that annoys & disappoints me. When I cancelled this course I was thinking I can always go back and do the course with them later on. But after how they have treated this incident, I don't think I will ever go back to them, nor will I recommend anyone.",Person,,Anish R,https://uk.trustpilot.com/users/5f0425259629d4e1a524380f,Thing,Firebrand Training,Organization,Trustpilot,https://uk.trustpilot.com,Rating,4

It is well known that many apprentices feel dissatisfied with terrible learning mentors that are completely clueless about coursework. Over the course of my apprenticeship I have had 2 different learning mentors after the first one was sacked. The two have completely contradicted each other on many occasions and left me confused on how to progress. It took months to mark my first project, once it was marked I was informed that it was all perfect by 2 different mentors and happy to go ahead. Once it was passed to the quality team I was unfortunately informed 6 months after my submission that it’s completely wrong and needs to be re-written. It’s such a shame that the apprenticeship side of firebrand are completely incompetent because the one week commercial courses are excellent.

Course itself was OK-ish. Lots of jumping around, referring to material that is not going to be part of the exam and refusing to explain in detail material that IS supposed to be part of the exam. Some parts of the material not explained at all as the course host ""doesn't really like them"". I was still able to learn something from it, but I wonder if it's the case of books I was supplied with prior to the course (which are excellent by the way). 

Course was quite exhausting overall: 3 days, up to 12h a day of cramming information (which wouldn't be that bad if it was structured well). I can't recommend this kind of approach, as around 7 PM it was rather difficult to maintain attention after 11 hours of listening and doing labs. I'm sure the course would be way better in person, but the online delivery had many limitations (such as complete inability to interact with other group members). 
It would work way better as 4 or 5 day course, but Firebrand keeps it as 3 day bootcamp to be able to couple the course I have taken with one more course over few following days. 

Can't say I'm massively disappointed as I wasn't the one paying for the course, but overall I feel like there was a lot of wasted potential. Instead of taking part in this lengthy course, it would be better for you to just read the books written by Microsoft on the subject.

His use of analogies (trains!) were really helpful in taking away the scary networking side of how things work and he used common life scenarios which made much more sense as a learner and this was then easily applied to the network side of learning. 

Phil was fair with having tea breaks, conscious of my progression throughout the week and reassured me by covering what to expect on the exam.

I'm pleased to say that I passed my exam the day after this course ended and Phil played a big part in this outcome. 

Here's hoping my future courses are with Phil. He's a great character with lots of interesting stories which makes the learning a lot more fun.

I cannot stress this enough, how this company is allowed to provide any offering for training is beyond me, I would rate this negative starts if this was possible. 

One thing I’d like to set straight is the actual instructors at Firebrand have been very good in my experience, very knowledgeable and agree with us that it’s the support staff around them that are the let down. The learning mentors and admin staff are simply terrible. You WILL NOT get the help that you require, students with learning difficulties WILL NOT get the help they so very much need, resources will not be sent out on time for courses or at all, projects submitted will either be marked incorrectly because of lack of knowledge from their end or just not marked at all. Learning mentors do not care and the senior leadership team at firebrand will happily look the other way. Trying to find a competent member of staff in the back office is like finding a needle in a haystack.

Great overall experience 1st time round. Fast forward to March and I attended FB again and took and failed CCISO with ec-council. Whilst I hold my hands up and admit to my own failure, a number of issues outside my control possibly contributed to my poor exam experience (missed pass by 5%). Our instructor was a really nice guy and very knowledgable, but there was a delay in him sending revision materials on the 1st night (he emailed us helpful info including test questions) but we received after midnight after I had already gone to bed - so I effectively lost a nights study as I got tired waiting. On top of this we were advised NOT to refer to the official ec-council study book during induction.The following 2 and a half days during class the slides used for the course were not provided in paper format - so we could not take precise notes against each slide(we were told this material was the property of the instructors company and could only take smartphone pictures). You try taking 100 pics from back of the class and refer to later in the evening ! The final negative experience was the tense wait on the day of the exam. There was an issue receiving the exam tokens from ec-council and they only came to us by email 30 minutes before the scheduled start of exam - not the best preparation as we were anxious all morning and at one stage some of us were wondering if our exam would be postponed ! As I said...I take responsibility for my failure, but I can't help thinking the overall course experience didn't help me either.",Person,,Sean McMahon,https://uk.trustpilot.com/users/5e498791bef4a4d327702882,Thing,Firebrand Training,Organization,Trustpilot,https://uk.trustpilot.com,Rating,3

220,Review,2020-02-12T12:49:03+00:00,Accelerated learning done right!,en,"Firebrand has trained me so far in 4 Microsoft technologies with qualifications at the end. There is no doubt the immersive experience is the most suitable way to rapidly learn new content, and their delivery of this concept is impeccable. The whole set up is a well-oiled machine. They make you feel supported in your endeavours, even though the classroom can have a massive variation of abilities. It is not a shortcut to getting qualified, and it is not an easy option, it is hard work and very tiring and it will push you mentally, perhaps to tears depending on your constitution, however it is very rewarding, whether you pass or not because what you have learnt is embedded in your mind whether you know it or not.It is also a good opportunity to meet new people, share ideas and gain friends. In summation, if you use the time to train and don't try and do your job whilst you are training, you will definitely learn alot! And the Firebrand team will be there to support you along the way!

#Update
Just had a read through all of the 1-star reviews and for the majority (but not all), the issues seem to come down to incorrect expectations of what this company offers. Accelerated learning is just that, fast-paced and long days, any expectation of less seems odd. As for cost justification, the training is only a portion of what you are paying for, the majority goes into keeping you focused on the task at hand and not getting sidetracked. That means having your meals cooked for you, having unlimited drinks on tap, snacks, a bed to sleep in at night, a 1-minute commute to the classroom and not worrying about the things that normally interrupt you on a day to day basis (like a young family in my case). You are annexing yourself for the sole purpose of learning, and that in itself is where the value comes from. Simply saying buying a book and reading it is not an alternative because if you could have done that, you would not have gone on the course in the first place. The accommodation is not 5* by any means, but it is clean and comfortable and more than suitable for its primary purpose of sleeping and revision. I guess this is a perspective thing as these courses are for well-paid professionals potentially used to staying in far more luxurious hotels, but they are the good side of basic. These trainers put in 12+ hour days and will go above and beyond if you ask them, but you have to ask. There is a lot of reading to do in the evening, yes, the idea is you pre-read and go over in the classroom the next day and raise your issues along the way. Perhaps this style of training doesn't suit everyone, and you need to decide whether it is right for you before you go. Read all the emails they send you, they do warn you about requirements for previous experience before and after buying. And understand, they are training you to pass the qualification, you are not going to get 30 years of experience in your chosen course in a matter of days, you are going to be given the knowledge essential to passing the exams, the knowledge these companies that run certifications deem to be the most important overall. That is the important thing. You either fill in the gaps yourself afterwards having gained a solid foundation, walls and roof or you apply what you already know. The key takeaway from this, make sure you manage your expectations before purchasing.",Person,,Jon,https://uk.trustpilot.com/users/5e43f43f9f3d2918ec2901c0,Thing,Firebrand Training,Organization,Trustpilot,https://uk.trustpilot.com,Rating,5
221,Review,2020-02-09T12:35:23+00:00,Shocking experience,en,"I am taking a level 4 apprenticeship and Firebrand have been a constant bottleneck in my career progression.

I was told the wrong information about the coursework I had to do, and my learning mentor marked it off as 100% complete. It went through 2 rounds of QA with only some minor changes to be made, and then on the 3rd round of QA I was told that it had been marked completely wrong and I was missing a huge amount of the criteria and basically had to re-write all of it. I was originally told that this criteria would be covered by the employer reference, and it was only when I was due to be submitted into the endpoint assessment that I was told this was not the case and I had to do a load of extra work.

I also had my finish date moved back 3 times because of things like this, and the QA process taking so long. When my coursework finally passed all the QA checks, I was told that I was supposed to have filled out anothed document before they could send my portfolio to BCS. I was never told about this document because I was missed off the mailing list that got sent out about it. I now have to do this extra work, and once again will move my finish date back for the fourth time.

This is just the tip of the iceberg as I have been facing a constant battle of having to do extra work which I was never told about, or outright being told the wrong information. It has been extremely frustrating and I would not reccommend Firebrand to anyone wanting to do an apprenticeship. My colleagues have also experienced similar problems with Firebrand.

I attended Wybosted Lakes which is in the middle of nowhere but is perfectly suited to the kind of training I was undertaking. It is right next to the hotel facilities where the beds are comfortable the rooms are clean and pleasant and the food is plentiful, with a variety. 
The trainer (Kevin who I believe has now left for pastures new) was excellent in delivering the material. The Firebrand facilities lend themselves to the learning particularly well. The only reason I haven't given it 5 stars is that I never give anything 5 stars :-)",Person,,Belli,https://uk.trustpilot.com/users/5e281f8d616781515b85f1fe,Thing,Firebrand Training,Organization,Trustpilot,https://uk.trustpilot.com,Rating,4

324,Review,2019-10-30T09:32:31+00:00,Avoid for Apprenticeships,en,"""Accelerated"" courses - 12 hours of study a day - make sense if people choose them individually because they already know the content and need to revise for the exam. 

But they take people onto apprenticeships who don't already know the content and who need to *learn* on those courses - and the human brain can't effectively learn for more than six hours a day.

You're given access to video resources that are not truly fit for purpose, sent a course text (a proper, 400-page textbook) a week or two before the course, and then sit in a room for 10 hours a day being talked at - no knowledge or understanding checks - and expected to pass the exam on the last day?
It manages to be worse than useless.

All but one of the apprentices on my course - serious, engaged, committed professionals - were unprepared to take the examination, and while half scraped a pass, half did not.

They expect all apprenticeships to take 16 months (the British Computer Society - the certifying body - considers the one that I'm on to have a duration of 24 months). They push people to get projects in and then wait over 10 weeks to return them, so that the apprentice is in limbo, not knowing what they still need to achieve in their subsequent projects.

A mix of really good and really dire course tutors. 
A mix of very relevant and utterly useless resources. 
And a mix of highly engaged and hugely disinterested mentors.

Should I have given three stars then? No. When you're an apprentice with them, they have you over a barrel, you have no choice but to find a way to make it work. It's caused me and others serious stress and distress, and this takes it to the point of being really pretty rubbish in my view.",Person,,E.

Here's my summary.
1.  The course is tough and you need to be prepared for it. The days are long , and you will consume a huge amount of information. It's physically and mentally draining. 
2.  It's highly recommended you read the recommended ISC book, as instructed. 
3.  Whoever your trainer is, please be assured these folks know what they are talking about and on-hand whenever needed. 
4.  If your staying at Wyboston lakes, the facilities are fine.  Your meals and accommodation are paid for. There is a bar, a gym etc. Please note, your there to pass a tough exam and this is not a holiday, and in reality you won't have time to sit around like your at home.
5.  The Firebrand staff are always around and can answer questions or get what you need.
6.  Plenty of coffee, snacks and fruit.
5. Theres plenty of free parking.

Final thought....
Negative feedback is only left by those who fail the exam.  

Learn your stuff, put the effort in, prepare for an onslaught and you'll pass. The CISSP is not for everyone, it helps if your in, or from an infosec related background.

Sunday 9 to 7pm, Mon to Fri 830 to 7pm.  Pretty intense sessions and you would have thought we would have covered most topics.  Unfortunately this was not the case, the material provided did not cover up to 50% of that encountered in the test.  Told not to read the book and instead use slides (lecturer read off these mostly & a small review she had prepared). We did pre-tests questions, which I answered correctly on most occasions.  When I did the actual test I felt totally unprepared, many topics we hadn't even covered.  

Firebrand offers the opportunity to re-do the course for free but you need to pay exam fees, accommodation etc.  I wouldn't pay a penny to stay at that place again nor to do a course with such poor material.

I have done similar courses\exams in the past with other providers and the material was ten times better.  I mailed them and didn't even get a response.  Not sure how they have such a high rating on here as I spoke to other people that were also not happy. 

No idea how Lecturer reading off slides and providing pre-test questions that had nothing to do with actual test can be deemed worthy of a £6000 price tag.

No cash machines anywhere near or shops, couldn't even buy bottled water.  Had to leave room and walk back and forth to use the water machine, only small cups available.   Free coffee was really bad, food was OK though.

I was promised all sorts of blended learning exercises and labs to enhance the learning experience during the sales process. Unfortunately this was just false promises.

All that happened was that the instructor went through the official IAPP slides over the whole duration of the training.

There was no value added by Firebrand or anything to justify paying the premium charged. I would not recommend it to anyone - there are much better offerings on the market from other providers. 

I'm pleased to say that I passed my exam but the training by Firebrand did not have any part to play in this.

The accommodation was also very disgusting and in major need of an upgrade although I was offered a better  more modernised  room after expressing my disgust.

Most of the participants on the course echoed the same thoughts.",Person,https://user-images.trustpilot.com/5d91bdceaefbad2362502198/73x73.png,Jamal Ahmed,https://uk.trustpilot.com/users/5d91bdceaefbad2362502198,Thing,Firebrand Training,Organization,Trustpilot,https://uk.trustpilot.com,Rating,1

I am normally a big fan of the Firebrand training, but I feel a bit disappointed this time.
The course was supposed to start on Sunday evening but the trainer didn't appear and we were given a terribly formatted pdf to read to compensate for it. Next morning instead of trying to catch up, we spent two hours on introductions, had long breaks and finished by 5-6pm. The whole group was in panic, feeling we won't be ready for the exam.
I feel like the trainer didn't prepare us sufficiently for the exam, the class was starting late and finishing early, not the way I am used to with Firebrand. 
At the end of the course I didn't feel like I was ready for the exam and during the exam I saw a lot of questions, we didn't touch at all during the course.
I passed the exam, but I feel it's more due to lots of self study, which I was doing before, after and even during the course, and due to common sense rather than the course itself. Quite a pity, as I like the overall Firebrand concept of intensive study with an exam right after the course.",Person,,Natascha Kalinina,https://uk.trustpilot.com/users/5d8a37792bfdf5655f2a5eae,Thing,Firebrand Training,Organization,Trustpilot,https://uk.trustpilot.com,Rating,3

If already in the industry the studies aren't hard, but you still have to consume a massive load of information. Being isolated from the world when on the course makes it that much easier to get by it. Everything is taken care of, and the settings are nice and comfortable. The Firebrand team is very professional, supportive to your needs and easy going. 
I did consider to skip the course and take the exam directly, but am glad I didn't. The course has a PECB flavor to it, and the exam questions also. If one have not read the course material, the flavor of the exam questions may throw you out of your comfort zone even if very experienced in the topic. 
The only thing missing for me was a 'late night sandwich' around 10pm to keep me going for the night. Then I learned I just had to ask for it ;)

382,Review,2019-09-02T08:36:55+00:00,Learning and wasting your time?,en,"The courses are well organised and structured but the quality of the course really depends on who the tutor is. Having participated 2 courses already I can easily say that I enjoyed the first one a lot more.  We were staying at the training center fro 5 days and our tutor made sure that we got to know each other and integrated. The second course I felt like sitting at the same table with complete strangers and the course was not as enjoyable as the first one.  
One thing I am very upset about is miscommunication. You are required to spend 20% time at work, on so called, off the job training. At the beginning of the course we were told that IMPACT modules were part of the OTJ training and suddenly now 6 months later they have decided to change this. This sounds like a not such a big deal but those IMPACT modules are pointless and take a lot of your time. I can tell that you need to spend at least 30 hours on completing modules on: sexting, teenage relationship abuse or grooming which is a waste of time and has nothing to do with your course or your job. This is a government requirement and Firebrand has no control over this but they should not mislead the students and I just wanted to give my honest opinion on some parts of the course. 
Another ridiculous thing is that they will make you take Maths or English exams if you do not have an English GCSE's equivalent, even though you have a degree! You could be a Doctor of Engineering coming from abroad but you would still have to take those exams which is another joke. 
Overall, I am happy with communication and support I am now receiving from Firebrand but if I was to recommend the training I would say think twice!, as you will end up learning but also wasting a lot of your precious time!",Person,,Emma ,https://uk.trustpilot.com/users/5d6cd4a7956e09d3e6a35f93,Thing,Firebrand Training,Organization,Trustpilot,https://uk.trustpilot.com,Rating,3

For example, I completed an MTA Software Development Fundamentals course, yet programming is not remotely involved in my role. Also, the title of the qualification, 'Infrastructure', is misleading as I work in a completely separate department to networking. It would have been nice to have a standard available that matches my job role with a title that is similar to my job role.

The courses are too intensive and require a substantial amount of information to be retained in such a small amount of time, which means the gained knowledge can be forgotten at a fast rate too.",Person,,Taylor Gill,https://uk.trustpilot.com/users/5d65440748da2a6e6af9e59c,Thing,Firebrand Training,Organization,Trustpilot,https://uk.trustpilot.com,Rating,3

The last course could be improved as I was missing the technical in-dept I kept asking for but was told would not show up in the exam. However, it turned out that the technical part was a big part of the exam and went way deeper that discussed during the training. 

Also the course is at least 1 day to short as I believe to be a big part of the reason why only a mall percentage of people are passing each time due to the amount of matter/content one needs to absorb in 5 days. 

And since this is a costly course (even a retake of the exam alone is already EUR 500,-) I see some improvements there.

The facilities are very good. Very clean and a good environment for studying. I went out running around the complex every day and really enjoyed it.

The bedrooms are starting to look a bit dated. I have been to Firebrand in 2015 and I noticed the difference. That said the rooms are clean and the staff are very helpful. The food is also great. Many different dishes catered for along with as much fizzy pop or coffee as you can drink.

The issues for me were: The course was supposed to be 3 days. There was only really days and the third for the exam. I didn't do a lot of prep work before attending and felt the course would cover it all. However it didn't. We ran out of time and galloped through the last bit of content. This showed in the exam as I was ill prepared for it.

I raised the concern with Firebrand but haven't heard anything back, which is disappointing. I felt the course was more geared to passing the exam instead of learning the content.

My recommendation if you are attending a Firebrand course. Study before you go. You wont have time to get through all the content even with 12 hour days. Learn 60% of the content before going and top up the missing content while there.",Person,,Neil,https://uk.trustpilot.com/users/5ce2c64b1df2c93ebb8c04c8,Thing,Firebrand Training,Organization,Trustpilot,https://uk.trustpilot.com,Rating,3

Also there seems to be an endless array of url's to go to that,  whilst appreciated, would potentially be better if stored in a single repository of go-to links for the course in Onefile.
That aside, everyone is friendly, helpful and the course itself whilst being a little woolly at times (seems to cover anything and everything to do with computers and data at times from SQL, R, Analysis, data science, big data, databases, architecture etc) is running at a not impossible pace and is already yielding benefits.

Hope this helps and doesn't sound like a dig, the course is very good and I appreciate the work that had gone into making it as good as it is.

Communication was downright appalling at times. The 1st apprenticeship mentor given couldn't organise a school trip (although he was given 30+ apprentices to himself alone which did not help matters). Then had to wait until coursework was RE-MARKED twice (After that mentor resigned) to THEN be told that I was missing one of the competencies required to pass and had to complete another project to fill this gap - 3 months after the already delayed end date. All of this for a qualification that I could have gotten the equivalent of at school. Laughable.

Each time he went of topic I placed a tick in the margin, 3 days into the course I had filled so many I gave up. I can honestly say that very little of the content of his training actually appeared in the exam.

Though I failed marginally this is not ""sour grapes"". I am a 63 professional who has spent over 35 years in the Security/Cyber industry. I feel that the course was a waste of my time and I would have been better served by staying in my room and studying the book.

Unfortunately several people failed the course - and I personally managed to scrape through due to my life experience of delivering security technologies & services.

Furthermore - firebrand should have provided the text books upon purchasing the course, so that everyone had the option to begin prepping ahead rather than being given the book on the first day and having to cram from the get go.

526,Review,2019-04-01T14:18:19+00:00,CCNP Routing & Switching,en,"On reflection, I would not use Firebrand again for the following reasons.

1. The pace of the course is just way too fast. Three exams in 8 days isn't realistic. Also, using one instructor for three disciplines, at that level, just doesn't work. Our tutor admitted he hadn't even sat these exams himself.

2. The Cisco course materials are inadequate preparation for the exams. There were questions in the exams that are not covered in the courseware. This isn't Firebrand's fault, but the tutor ought to know where the gaps are. Ours didn't (see point 1).

3. One of the sets of course materials was not provided. This was rasied during the course and most of us settled for a free exam voucher as compensation, however it caused friction between the candidates and Firebrand staff at a time when friction was the opposite of what we needed.

4. The facilities at The Willows are not the best. It feels dated and un-loved. My room was not very clean either. Again, this isn't directly attributable to Firebrand but it is part of the overall package and should be better.

Having used Firebrand three times now, I am not sold on the ""accelerated training"" format. It prioritises speed over quality and backs this up with a guarantee that unsuccessful candidtes can study again for free. Only it isn't free because you have to pay for everything except the tuition fees. So it isn't really a guarantee at all.

As a training course, it was OK. I picked up some good knowledge and left in better shape than when I arrived. As an exam preparation tool, it falls short (this one, at least). My advice to potential candidates would be to self-study until you think you are ready and then go on this course to bring you up to boiling point, or go to Global Knowledge and do the full week course for each exam.",Person,,Stuart Taylor,https://uk.trustpilot.com/users/5ca21daa54d7e4c0fa007b2f,Thing,Firebrand Training,Organization,Trustpilot,https://uk.trustpilot.com,Rating,3

I was lucky enough to have a great group of guys in my class and a Brilliant Trainer Rakesh. I studied for VMware VCP 6.7. The course was very very intensive and we went through LOTS of content in the 5 day course. The benefit of Firebrand training is that you are away from the normal day to day distractions of your job so that you can be 100% focused on learning. No worries about preparing food etc, everything is laid on. It does seem that very few people actually pass their exam at the end of the week, however this is optional and you don't have to take the test if you feel you are not ready. I decided to go for it to see what I was up against. I have a copy of the material we went through during the week of training so i will continue to review this and prepare for the resit of my exam!

Hands down it is exhausting and taking two exams at the level of difficulty like Java 8 SE OCA/OCP within one week is not for the faint-hearted.
However you would hardly ever get any better chance to succeed in this task at that pace.
This was among the most intense training experiences I've ever had, with one of the best trainers I've ever met, a real Java Expert being able to answer almost any question right off the bat and teach the unteachable within the limited amount of time. He got the penny to drop for me on several things I didn't understand within 4 months self-studying before, and he made it within 5 minutes!
The whole training is extremely focussed on getting you to learn and understand everything that's needed to easily pass the exam, as long as you've been doing the basics beforehand. You have little to no distraction, ensuring you're totally committed to your objectives all the time.
At the same time, you meet other experts being in the same boat with you, giving you the chance to deepen your knowledge and understanding of the topics you're struggling with the most.
All in all, this was a week I will never forget, an intense experience second to none and definitely something I can recommend to anyone with real dedication and skills.
There's no better way to prove you're a pro.

Trainer was always able to effectively deconstruct complex/abstract ideas and then reconstruct them with association to real world scenarios of relevance to the training candidates who were often from varying and diverse backgrounds.

I called a month in advance to hear what they would recommend me to read prior to the course. I was told that ""All materials would be handed out on the first day, and that I wouldn't need any prior studying"".

Because of that, the course was really tough. And on average, I've had 5-6 hours a sleep, and almost no time for myself, during a 7 day period.

Also, I attended the course at Wyboston, and the bedrooms are not that good. The lights and chair in the room makes it almost impossible to study, which one will need.

On the plus side. I have learned A LOT! Not just for passing an exam, but knowledge that I can use in my day job.
Also, I passed, so apparently I gained enough knowledge during the week. I am sure however that it could have been less stressfull if I had gotten a study list in advance.

The teacher was very talented and professional, and always smiling. It was an absolute pleasure learning from someone that enjoys doing what they do.

Last but not least, in such a stressfull environment, you get closer to the people you study/work with. In just a week, I made a friendship with a fellow student, and it already feels like we've been friends since childhood.

So overall. I will absolutely recommend Firebrand.

Some would say that a downside is being away from your family for all of this time, but compared with having to study 2 nights a week for months on end, I feel that being away for a week has far less impact on family life. Additionally, you don't have to balance concentration between your day job as well as learning new knowledge and skills, often forgetting things by the start of the next week if you are fortunate enough to be able to switch off at weekends.

12hrs a day plus any evening study you choose to do is a hard slog, but investing this time does reap benefits. It's only a week, and having been through this process I successfully passed the CISSP and CCSP exams.

Venues are fantastic, and whilst being based in the UK, I chose not to wait for the next CCSP bootcamp in this country and travelled to the Netherlands instead. Quick flight over form Gatwick and overall travel time only slightly longer.

Tutors are also fantastic - so engaging and driven to help you meet your aims.

I started in IT way back in 1988, consulting and training. In 2001 in the UK I decided to take on my passion and provide consulting and training around information security, penetration testing and digital forensics. I have been working with many clients around the world and also delivering courses with many Approved Training Centres (ATCs) around the world as well in my long career. Firebrand Training is something truly special and unique as a training centre. As an instructor, they are one of the few that truly look after instructors. The staff at Firebrand Training is what makes them run smoothly and is what gives that risk immersive experience to delegates. For my certifications that I deliver, CEH, ECSA, CHFI and soon GPEN, GSEC, CISA and CISM etc. Firebrand Training provides me the platform to deliver BOOTCAMP style training, which is what is so necessary for security courses. My delegates/students immerse themselves into the content, both theory and most importantly practical labs and hands-on experience. Their results and feedback is always truly very positive and even after the course/certification is complete my relationship with the delegates/students continues. I have often said that a good training centre is one that gives delegates/students their certification and their pass of their exam, however a GREAT training centre is one that delegates/students NEVER forget their experience and rave about to their colleagues and friends and gives them a roadmap to change their lives.

1. The slides used by Firebrand were heavy on graphics but very low on meaningful content to use as a study aid for the exam.

The slides were also out of date and not in line with the technology being taught (for example, the slides were wrong regarding service tier recovery periods and geo active replication). The instructor resorted to using the Internet to find Microsoft documentation and then presented that instead. The “e-Book” provided was little more than screenshots of the same slides.

2. Other training providers offer anything between 3 to 5 days for such a course, whereas Firebrand only trained us for 1.5 days (the afternoon is for the exam). In effect, this was an information-cramming session, not a training or learning opportunity to gain new skills. 

3. No practice or lab exercises. As a result of the tight time-frame, we also had no time to complete the lab exercises, code PowerShell scripts or administer/configure Azure components ourselves. This was supposed to be included, but it never happened. 

The instructor responded to the above complaints by saying that this was apparently the first time Firebrand had run the course and that Microsoft didn’t provide adequate courseware. This is not an acceptable excuse as our contract is with Firebrand – not with Microsoft. We expect Firebrand to provide adequate service and materials, and not treat it's paying customers as guinea pigs. 

Some attendees managed to pass, but this doesn’t detract from the fact that the training received was far of low quality. 

What's also quite irksome is that the instructor was a contractor hired for the session, the practice tests were provided by a third party, the ""eBook' and slides were provided by a third party - which means all Firebrand did was stitch these together in order to feign an integrated course but it simply didn't work. There was no evidence of Firebrand's own IP or training expertise on show. What did we pay a premium for? 

In hindsight, it would have been better to use the Microsoft web pages for free (the same ones the instructor used during the course), buy some relevant books and then subscribe to the same third-parties for practice tests and book the exam. All of which would have cost only 30% of what Firebrand charged us.",Person,https://user-images.trustpilot.com/59c5f7400000ff000acc94de/73x73.png,MAK AK,https://uk.trustpilot.com/users/59c5f7400000ff000acc94de,Thing,Firebrand Training,Organization,Trustpilot,https://uk.trustpilot.com,Rating,1
620,Review,2017-09-20T16:24:43+00:00,"Great idea, poor execution",en,"Firebrand have got things horribly wrong for me. It's a long story so I'll try to summarise.

Began apprenticeship at firm as lvl 4 network engineer. Firm was a dental equipment manufacturer, looking for a network expert to train with them. The job involved very little networking and was more a service engineer for their equipment (XRay machines, Dental chairs, CAD-CAM systems)... all very fascinating stuff but mentor knew nothing about networking and did not offer me any time with IT/networking business, nor time for study.

Firebrands first mistake here is that the company was not vetted to ensure what happens in the role relates to the framework. Had Firebrand done this, I would have not been placed there. Ultimately I made the choice to seek a new employer.

I found a new employer who I am still working for after more than 12 months. I don't feel much further forward in the apprenticeship. This is due to the role not quite matching the framework again. Indeed this time it is partly the employers responsibility to ensure the correct exposure to live systems is given, and mentoring is done by someone who knows networking... obviously this isn't happening or I wouldn't be posting.

Time is ticking for me now, with a number of courses looming, an incomplete journal and little idea of how to tackle project work showing any level of proficiency. Some dialogue is supposed to be taking place between the employer and Firebrand in order to get me some exposure, but this is taking too long and I can now already see the end of the apprenticeship.

Firebrand's course are actually very good, so hence them gaining 1 star. But everything else about them, their communication, the attitude to students is lacking. Make no mistake they will re-iterate the fact that this is an employer led apprenticeship and much of the power is out of their hands. They are not pushing my employer for experience.

Anyway, think very carefully before using them as although their courses are good, most other aspects about them are poor.",Person,https://user-images.trustpilot.com/59c296470000ff000acb8cb1/73x73.png,Matthew Richardson,https://uk.trustpilot.com/users/59c296470000ff000acb8cb1,Thing,Firebrand Training,Organization,Trustpilot,https://uk.trustpilot.com,Rating,1

622,Review,2017-08-02T23:30:15+00:00,"CISSP Bootcamp: Risk Lowered, Cost Justified & Objectives Met with Great Results; Highly Recommended",en,"I went to Firebrand on the recommendation of several colleagues who'd previously qualified with them for their CISSP. I did the same and I too qualified; on my very first attempt!

In fact I went on the course totally unprepared and without any prep or alternative sources of books, etc., like a lot of people do. I also hadn't prepared primarily because I didn't have the time to do so. I must admit that I did have over 15-years of experience to fall back on (3x the prerequisite). Although my knowledge, prior to going on the course, hadn't come from the relevant textbooks, I knew a lot of it from working in Information Security and other related technology courses, etc. So, my lack of time and opportunity to prepare properly was precisely the reason why I needed, and chose, Firebrand Training to consolidate that experience and formalise it in preparation for my qualification all in one go.

The advantage of Firebrand is that they provide a totally immersive and intensive training programme. They look after all of the little details, from the usual training material and course collateral, etc., to even the coffee and snacks during the breaks. The location, the facilities, the course, the instructors and administrators are all geared to nothing other than getting you trained and ready for certification. That makes the learning even more intense, because there a few distractions. Still don't come expecting an easy ride. The hours are long but that too is catered for. All you have to do is turn up and follow the course as prescribed. Don't get me wrong, my CISSP course and qualification was no walk in the park. You still had to work very hard, pay attention and participate fully. But, if you follow the instructors' advice and pay attention to the detail and advice they're offering you, you should do well. Of course, there's no guarantee of success, and don't expect to be spoon fed the information and answers to the exam questions. Some qualifications aren't about learning your times tables by heart or ensuring that you know what 4x4 or else you'll fail. Different people will have different methods of learning, absorbing information and passing exams, but on this training course, everything worked perfectly for me, because the results speak for themselves. I needed the cocoon away from work, life even family to concentrate on the goal of getting qualified, which Firebrand's training provided.

The instructor was great. He was definitely experienced both in the field and in delivering training courses, which I feel is just as important. He was clear, definitely knew his stuff without doubt. He also had lots of great techniques and advice and covered the training material passing all the information across in a fairly well structured, and paced, manner. Would be happy to have him on other courses and would probably enjoy working along side of him. I know I'd learn a thing or two from him.

The other main reason I chose Firebrand, was that you didn't have to go on the course then schedule your exam somewhere else or later down the road. They did it all for you as part of the course. You were trained, and then you sat the exam. All-in-one was just what I needed. You could choose to delay taking your exam, but I didn't see the point and again that worked perfectly for me as I got the result I needed. I'd taken a week out of my work and away from my family with the sole clear objective of qualification not simply training.

Another plus for Firebrand is that they ran the course on a regular and frequent basis so I had options for timing that suited me.

That brings me to the cost of my course, which I could take a star away for, but I will not and I'll explain why:
Firebrand training doesn't come cheap; I'm also a self-employed contractor. So, when I take time off work it costs me loss-of-earnings. When I spend a lot of money on top of that loss, then I need to justify the risk to recouping the total cost. I estimated that this risk, by not-qualifying, was reduced through spending the extra amount with Firebrand than either self-study, online training or going with another organisation, offering a less-costly training course but that wasn't as immersive as Firebrand in its training. I was justified by qualifying in 7-days flat! So I cannot really complain about the cost (no matter how much I disliked spending that much money) because my risk-based analysis was definitely cost-justified.

Finally, I have to mention how easy it was for me to register and do all the admin related to the course. The Firebrand team where very helpful efficient and friendly, right from first phone call through to handing me my exam pass letter. I managed to call, book, pay for my course and schedule everything within about 15-30mins, all-in. I received clear instructions almost immediately, and everything was taken care of for me from that point on. They even processed my exam and made it, again, easy for me to just focus on my objective not deal with the details. I have to give a shout out to 'Paul' at the training centre. He was great. His advice on how to prepare for the 6-hour exam and the strategy for how to sit it was spot on.

I would recommend Firebrand Training. I personally intend to use them again. Please, note that my recommendation is not a guarantee that if you go with them and take their courses you will definitely meet your objectives, whatever they maybe (training or passing an exam, etc.). But if you read my experience and it makes sense to you then I recommend you also look at what kind of person you are, consider your circumstances and take a moment to analyse the risk associated with your training and work out whether the cost is justifiable in your case or not. Also ensure that the you are comfortable with the people and that the processes around the training are right for you and/or your people.",Person,,ScubaYass,https://uk.trustpilot.com/users/598260860000ff000ab6d070,Thing,Firebrand Training,Organization,Trustpilot,https://uk.trustpilot.com,Rating,5

The course was very well delivered and the instructor Colin Cussans was excellent.  At all times Colin did his utmost to ensure the delegates were able to understand how the course content applied to real world scenarios.

What I would add though, is due to the intensive nature of the training, it is very difficult to both digest all of the content on the course and the additional reading that is required with the added pressure of taking the exams.  I would strongly recommend delaying the exams until after you have finished the course and you can digest and consolidate what you have learnt.

I would also recommend to take each segment of the course separately rather than as a nine day block owing to how much work and commitment is required in such a short time. Otherwise the course and the facilities are both excellent and delivered to the highest standard, and in Colin they have one the best training instructors I have had the pleasure of being taught by and would recommend Colin and Firebrand as a result.",Person,,Edwin Brigdale,https://uk.trustpilot.com/users/5857b0a80000ff000a6339f3,Thing,Firebrand Training,Organization,Trustpilot,https://uk.trustpilot.com,Rating,4

During the training the slides used were very much text based and thus making it difficult to memorize. Also the structuring of the slides was not too good e.g. mostly only bullets were used for table of contents etc.
Beside these facts, the training staff was good.

680,Review,2016-11-02T12:30:12+00:00,Will only go back because of the excellent Firebrand staff at Wyboston Lakes.,en,"I will start with the positives. 
1) The staff at the training centre could not do enough to assist. Any problems or issues they would look into resolving immediately. My impression of the staff there was that they would go above and beyond to help. Fantastic. They are the ONLY reason I will come back.

2) The students. Formed a fantastic bond with many of the students on the course and now have a lot of very experienced linkedin contacts who I can call on throughout my career.

3) The labs. The labs were very good but unfortunately the amount of time allocated to them was tiny. So basically it was just a rush to get it done, using click click click mouse, not really having enough time to understand what you were doing, so not as much learned as possible. This was especially the case when the more complex labs like creating a S2S VPN was carried out.

Now, the negatives.

1) The course started with an introduction to Azure, yet the course pre-requisites state you need experience in Azure, so a day at least was wasted on trivial subject material which is not going to earn any points towards the exams. 

2) The Exam prep books. I asked Firebrand to send me the books for the course 6 months before my course date so I could study them. They refused this multiple times so I had to buy the books myself so that I could prepare for the course. I now have 2 copies of each book. This is totally ridiculous and we were then given ""room-work"" of reading the book when we were finishing lectures at 930pm, hence expecting us to continue study until at least midnight.

3) The architect part of the course. 70-534. There was NO course content on what was the hardest exam of the 3. I remember asking the course tutor to show me specific things like Microsoft System Centre but was told I did not need to know much about this, apart from that you can use Azure with it. This was NOT the case. This week does not prepare anyone for the 70-534 exam, in any way whatsoever, even the tutor is not aware of what content is covered on this exam. Poor show Firebrand !

4. The hotel - We were served chicken that was uncooked and had blood pouring out of it. Terrible.
The internet connection in the hotel is very good but only in certain areas. If your room has poor internet, you have to move rooms. I had to do this.",Person,,TheodanUK,https://uk.trustpilot.com/users/52dfe62800006400015fdf67,Thing,Firebrand Training,Organization,Trustpilot,https://uk.trustpilot.com,Rating,3
681,Review,2016-10-16T14:56:55.705+00:00,Scam artists. Should be criminalised,en,"Atrocious. Complete scam artists. If I was to go in depth to reveal the level of utter disappointment firebrand is, it would take me hundreds of pages. I will give a brief overview of some of the main reasons firebrand training is a poor decision if you want IT training.

1) Fundamentally the concept is flawed. Their USP is 'accelerated training' but this translates to having 12 hour lectures every day. This is not conducive to good learning - most people will learn by doing the thing they are trying to learn. Being talked at for 12 hours just does not work, studies have shown this time and time again. I can't say, after the training I have done, that I learned anything more than what I would have in a traditional environment in the same amount of time - that is to say, I have now less understanding than i would have had, had I gone to a traditional training provider. 

2) Their marketing materials are dodgy, and in some ways are outright lies (and to me should be illegal). When you join, they give you a really juvenile questionnaire, that ostensibly is meant to judge what 'kind of learner you are'. I know that I am a hands on learner - i prefer to do things in order to learn them (not simply be told how to do them), however, everyone who took this questionnaire was suspiciously heavily weighted towards 'audio' based learning (convenient, as their teaching method is talking at you for 12 hours because there is no time for practical work). So this is basically a confidence trick to make you think that you're getting the teaching style that is appropriate for you. However - more importantly - and I will put this in caps so it is crystal clear - IF YOU ARE AN APPRENTICE, YOU DO NOT GET THE QUALIFICATIONS THEY PROMISE. On their website you will see it plastered everywhere that you will gain the qualifications if you take a course which has one. However, this is not true for apprentices for some arbitrary reason - however, do you think they mention this ANYWHERE? Do you think anyone knew this before signing a contract with Firebrand? Of course not! A complete scam!

3) Their communication is pitiful. It's difficult for me to put into words the  level of incompetence of firebrand in the communication department. It is almost comical how poor it is - on one occasion, they sent us a training date, only for us to arrive after an almost 2 hour journey on this date to be told that they cancelled it - and didn't bother to inform us. Great! Not only that it took us several months just to get the dates in order because they were just completely unclear as to when the training will take place. Their course identifications were wrong, which led to MORE communication issues. This isn't to say you don't get a lot of emails however, in fact, you get so many your eyes begin to glaze over when you receive another. Really, this is only the beginning of frustration you will face dealing with Firebrand.

4) You're just a paycheck to them. Whilst I was there Ofsted was doing an inspection so they take all Apprentices aside into a room and basically threatened us into telling ofsted that everything was okay. I'm not joking, the lady was shouting, quite threateningly, that she could ""stop our money"" if we didn't tell ofsted that everything was okay. (Although she couldn't stop our money, so I'm not sure what she was talking about). 

This only scratches the surface of how bad firebrand is. And trust me when I say these words don't come close to expressing the level of disappointment I have after training with firebrand. It is easily the worst career decision I have ever made.

However, I should mention that I have decided to remain in the process of completing my apprenticeship, so these views are preliminary for now (I have completed 3 of the 5 sets of training). I will of course update this review if my sentiment changes, if not, it shall remain as is.",Person,,Simon,https://uk.trustpilot.com/users/580395250000ff000a4e0965,Thing,Firebrand Training,Organization,Trustpilot,https://uk.trustpilot.com,Rating,1

685,Review,2016-05-16T21:46:50+00:00,Low pass rate! Too expensive for what it is,en,"Hello 

I did a SCCM course with Firebrand which is normally a 9 day course if you want to learn it properly. This course was sold to me as done in 4 days with a 95% pass rate. Only 2 out of 8 people in my class passed the exam. They dont tell you how many times people need to reset the exam before they pass. The instructor told us that it is a low pass rate on the first day! And that last time only 1 out of 4 students passed. It was meant to be 4 days of 12 hour lessons..you will get about 200+ pages of reading to do as home work every night too. The course was 3.5 days (doing 6 to 8 modules a day) as on the 4th day you do your exam in the afternoon. You can take a voucher for the exam but if you fail you need to pay £100 again to reset it. I paid £3450. So about a £1000 per day! They mentioned that you will get a full cooked breakfast you get unlimited snacks and drinks through the day included in the price. There is no cooked breakfast only continental breakfast and there is 1 vending machine in the whole complex which you have to pay for! There is a coffee machine that you can use. There are no shops or anything around for you to get anything. There is 1 dish choice for lunch and 1 dish choice for dinner. Its just an unhealthy way to learn and the food must have been no more than £10 per head. Rooms are standard and clean and bathroom is like hospital bathrooms in your room. I was told I would be given a call by the customer services manager to discuss this 3 days ago and no one has called me even though I have chased this. Everyone in my class had their company pay for their course and got it alot cheaper then I did. If this  is a course you want to learn to develop your career and you have been saving money for a long time like I did and looking to pay for it out if your own pocket, then please do not do this with Firebrand. Please ask someone who has done it before and go where the overall standard of the course is better and its about teaching at a good pace with a good pass rate. You want to attend a course that is worth while even if it is a few days longer. Firebrand seem to be just about the money as I had many calls before I started the course to secure my place and now the manager wont even ask. My friend did this course same time as me with Koenig in Goa for £900 over 9 days. He did 3 modules a day and practised exam questions from the textbook and passed with a good score.",Person,,Ricky,https://uk.trustpilot.com/users/573a3e3e0000ff000a20a8d2,Thing,Firebrand Training,Organization,Trustpilot,https://uk.trustpilot.com,Rating,1

The only downside is the days are long and hard. Studying for 12 hours a day. If you are a novice, then this is probably to much, if you have some exposure to the subject matter then you should be fine. They do condense it down, so getting a grasp on a new concept can be hard.
I passed all 6 exams and left certified.

My 2nd course was for VMware. again it was well laid out and taught well. Still hard work with long days, and studying in the evening.

777,Review,2015-10-03T18:06:03+00:00,"Cheaper alternatives, better quality alternatives",en,"TL:DR
Stay well clear from this company. Success rate is very low on passing exams, costs are high, level of detail in training is more like a high-level summary. and so far their customer service is just non-existent as they would rather lose multiple future customers, rather than refund money for one customer!      Look else where!

Booking process:
I contacted Firebrand about the MTA SQL Server course, and shortly after was given a call by Marcus Costerton from their sales team.
Marcus did a great job in up-selling me from a £1200 course to a £6,000 MCSA course, without really doing much to establish my actual level of knowledge before hand.
But to be far, having met the other delegates on the course, I came to realise that Firebrand didn't really care about what your level of knowledge was, it was just trying to fill in the seats for courses that were only a few weeks ahead and not yet full. Money grabbing without a care of how they affect you.
I have no formal training on MS SQL, just self taught at work. 

The course quality:
The course, delivered by Angela, was possibly the most boring, 1990, death-by-powerpoint presentation you could be forced to sit through. Even worse was the lack of depth provided in the training. The idea it seems, is to rush students through with a high-level summary of what key words are in SQL Server, and just hope they pass the exams. 
Firebrand like to claim you get trained in twice the speed, but every other company I see out there only seems to take 1 extra day to deliver the same course, but at a much smaller price.

Our course tutor made it clear in the first hour or two, that on average a class size of 13-16 people that do the firebrand SQL Server courses, 1, maybe 2 candidates will successfully pass the entirety of the MCSA certification exams. That's a shockingly bad pass rate and demonstrates their level quality and success at training people.

Don't expect to walk away from FireBrands SQL MCSA training, thinking you'll understand how the SQL query engine works, or what the full difference is between ISNULL and COALESCE, or the difference in acceptable input and returned values are between PARSE() and CONVERT(), because that depth of knowledge is not covered by Firebrand. Instead they just present to you the key words found in SQL and show a way to get them working with non-realistic and poor data examples against a cut down version of AdventureWorks database.

In fact lets be clear about this, Firebrand use a freely available Adventureworks db, to cover off a freely available list of Microsoft SQL Server reserved words, and present it to you in a very boring, and poorly organised powerpoint slide.

Angela was skitting about between different pre-made SQL scripts and powerpoint slides all the time, showing to be unorganised, and often saying ""we'll skip this"" or ""will come back to that later"" demonstrating how scatty and poorly organised this lesson is.

I would highly recommend buying many of the available books out there to cover more in depth explanation on how SQL works and better increase your chances of learning useful information and passing the exams.

Other considerations:
Hotel was a bit rubbish. The rooms are like uni student accommodations, and my bedsheets were ripped and had a dead bug in it on the first night. The building gets really cold and you only have a tiny radiator to warm up the room.

There was no need to install the rubbish 3rd party software that firebrand tells you about when you first sign up, be aware they do send you a lot of emails as a very messy method of trying to prepare you before you attend the course.

I found the delivery of this course to be so pathetic in quality, detail, and lack of hands-on time with real-world usage, that I left early.

I am still in the process of discussing with Firebrand about getting money back, something which they have so far refused to do despite how low quality their service is and the cheaper alternatives out there.
I very much see this going to the small claims court.

Consider this: Why do you think Firebrand offer ""free re-training"" for candidates who don't pass their exams! If they delivered quality training a much higher % of students would pass first time, not the 2nd or 3rd time of attending their courses like some of our class were doing!",Person,https://user-images.trustpilot.com/4fecc26400006400011c2898/73x73.png,Robert,https://uk.trustpilot.com/users/4fecc26400006400011c2898,Thing,Firebrand Training,Organization,Trustpilot,https://uk.trustpilot.com,Rating,1

779,Review,2015-09-30T10:14:01.066+00:00,First visit to Firebrand,en,"I attended a Firebrand training course recently. The CEH. I was very nervous about attending such a course with an immersive style. I had read reviews on Google as everyone does beforehand. I had read some reviews about Firebrand being this and Firebrand being that.

I can for sure say the Firebrand course I attended was the best training course I have been on. I have been working in the IT industry for over 20 years and attended a lot of courses.

I'd like to breakdown the review:
Facilities were superb. The classroom was well presented and had great equipment that just worked from day one. Snacks and refreshments were on hand 24 hours a day and we had a secure pass to the building. The hotel complex was great. Most of your time is spent studying but that doesn't mean to say you should stay in a shack. Wyboston Lakes was fantastic and the food was great.

Course Content: The course speed was frenetic as expected. Lots of studying in my room helped. The tutor was great. Very approachable, very accommodating. I had heard you can't ask any questions because the pace is intense. This was not the case. Our tutor always had time for questions and encouraged some debates.

I was quite nervous about the exam of Friday, but my tutor helped me prepare for it, and even said if I wanted to return to do it I could. This I thought was a nice touch as it highlighted the Firebrand way was not about just getting people through exams.

In summary I would recommend the Firebrand way to anyone serious about wanting IT training. Make sure you prepare yourself before attending and take the minimum requirements seriously. Do not attend a course where you know absolutely nothing about it as you will put enormous pressure on yourself to pass. Use any spare time to study and prepare - this definitely helps. Review your day in your bedroom before the next day.",Person,,Neil Kendall,https://uk.trustpilot.com/users/55f68ab00000ff0001db94da,Thing,Firebrand Training,Organization,Trustpilot,https://uk.trustpilot.com,Rating,5

Initial contact & booking.
My initial contact, Adam Nathan, asked questions to ascertain my background and why I wanted to do the course and answered any questions I had. I was very happy with the way this went.
I received follow up emails (not from Adam) with attachments and links to various sources of information about the course. This again seemed good at the time. One attachment referred to a specific piece of software to access the digital courseware, this did not apply to this course as the courseware was preloaded on the systems. Another attachment was titled “Accessing your eBook” which talked about a voucher which never materialised.

The Course.
The course seems to have been thrown together in a hurry.
The trainer’s only reference material seemed to be the Microsoft learning site which listed the headings for the items in the syllabus. There did not seem to be ant Learning Plan or Training spec developed for this course. These should have been put together by Firebrand, and the course piloted before it was signed off for delivery to paying customers. Most of the courseware had just been modified from an earlier version in which some of the older references had been missed.
I would hope that this course is now being revised as a matter of urgency, as the failure rates of the exams would be unacceptably high for any serious training provider.
I have 19 years training experience (15 in IT applications training), which has included the design of courses, and knowledge of the support documentation that every professionally designed course should have in place.",Person,,Keith Harris,https://uk.trustpilot.com/users/5579c6350000ff0001c5555a,Thing,Firebrand Training,Organization,Trustpilot,https://uk.trustpilot.com,Rating,2

Having already attended a multitiude of different courses re Hi Tech Crime I found that Firebrand was more in tune with the investigative mindset required for Cyber Crime. The assessment and acquisition of live data that would otherwise be lost to those investigating individuals/groups responsible for hacking type offences is vital. The explanation of basic networks was insightful and well delivered and overall the instructors were easy to talk to and were able to provide case study examples of previous criminal investigations which provided context.

The accommodation was reasonable, nothing especially good but you don't tend to spend long in your room. There is free Wifi in the hotel and in the Firebrand training centre, but the Wifi is accessible by anyone (Firebrand Wifi is password protected but they hand it out to everyone who is training there, and the hotel is an unlocked network) so I wouldn't be doing any online banking with the hacking courses they teach.

There are only a few minor drawbacks to the accommodation, firstly there is no phone signal at all (I'm with EE), secondly you don't get any drinks with your meals apart from water, free decent drinks are included in the Firebrand center so don't forget to take one to dinner with you, and lastly the unlimited snacks throughout the day only comprise of some mint imperials in a jar on their reception desk, another type of sweets (fruit pastel/wine gums I believe), or apples or bananas, there is a paid for vending machine though.

As far as the training is concerned, Firebrand is excellent, great for teaching you alot of information and getting you alot of certifications in a very short time.

Nothing but happy with the course and the result!,Person,,Matt Robbins,https://uk.trustpilot.com/users/51b725ab00006400013f4b89,Thing,Firebrand Training,Organization,Trustpilot,https://uk.trustpilot.com,Rating,5

Both courses where awesome and jam packed with the course ware but re-enforced with real world example, some great mental aids and quirky tutors which backed up the subject with humorous ways of memorizing the content.

These courses are both fantastic towards gaining an in depth view of the subject and also in taking the exams.

I met some fantastic individuals in an environment where I could both study, network and bounce off as well as two first class tutors who could demonstrate real world application to the subjects.",Person,https://user-images.trustpilot.com/51b725af00006400013f4b8b/73x73.png,Phil Robinson,https://uk.trustpilot.com/users/51b725af00006400013f4b8b,Thing,Firebrand Training,Organization,Trustpilot,https://uk.trustpilot.com,Rating,5

Everything I asked could be answered and it's a real bootcamp as how it should be. Only negative point is that the time that I had for the curriculum was too less.
